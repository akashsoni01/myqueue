Prosecutors investigating the former president’s handling of classified material have issued a wave of new subpoenas and obtained the confidential cooperation of a witness who worked at Mar-a-Lago.  Federal prosecutors investigating former President Donald J. Trump’s handling of classified documents have obtained the confidential cooperation of a person who has worked for him at Mar-a-Lago, part of an intensifying effort to determine whether Mr. Trump ordered boxes containing sensitive material moved out of a storage room there as the government sought to recover it last year, multiple people familiar with the inquiry said. Through a wave of new subpoenas and grand jury testimony, the Justice Department is moving aggressively to develop a fuller picture of how the documents Mr. Trump took with him from the White House were stored, who had access to them, how the security camera system at Mar-a-Lago works and what Mr. Trump told aides and his lawyers about what material he had and where it was, the people said. At the heart of the inquiry is whether Mr. Trump sought to hide some documents after the Justice Department issued a subpoena last May demanding their return. The existence of an insider witness, whose identity has not been disclosed, could be a significant step in the investigation, which is being overseen by Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. The witness is said to have provided investigators with a picture of the storage room where the material had been held. Little else is known about what prosecutors might have learned from the witness or when the witness first began to provide information to the prosecutors.  In the past few weeks, at least four more Mar-a-Lago employees have been subpoenaed, along with another person who had visibility into Mr. Trump’s thinking when he first returned material to the National Archives, according to people briefed on the matter. Two people said that nearly everyone who works at Mar-a-Lago has been subpoenaed, and that some who serve in fairly obscure jobs have been asked back by investigators. Prosecutors have also issued several subpoenas to Mr. Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, seeking additional surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago, his residence and private club in Florida, people with knowledge of the matter said. While the footage could shed light on the movement of the boxes, prosecutors have questioned a number of witnesses about gaps in the footage, one of the people said.  And they recently subpoenaed Matthew Calamari Sr., the longtime head of security at the Trump Organization who became its chief operating officer. His son, Matthew Calamari Jr., who is the company’s corporate director of security, was subpoenaed some time ago, according to a person familiar with the activity. Both would have insight into the security camera operation, according to people familiar with the matter. Both Calamaris appeared before the grand jury gathering evidence in the case on Thursday. CNN first reported that prosecutors planned to question them. One of the previously unreported subpoenas to the Trump Organization sought records pertaining to Mr. Trump’s dealings with a Saudi-backed professional golf venture known as LIV Golf, which is holding tournaments at some of Mr. Trump’s golf resorts. It is unclear what bearing Mr. Trump’s relationship with LIV Golf has on the broader investigation, but it suggests that the prosecutors are examining certain elements of Mr. Trump’s family business.  A spokesperson for Mr. Trump called the case “a targeted, politically motivated witch hunt” that is “concocted to meddle in an election and prevent the American people from returning him to the White House.” The spokesperson accused Mr. Smith’s office of harassing “anyone who has worked for President Trump” and of now using the inquiry to target Mr. Trump’s business. Investigators have been piecing together Mr. Trump’s handling of government documents for months, seeking information not just about his habits after leaving the White House but also about his practices as president. Among the information they have gathered in interviews concerned his habit of flushing material down toilets, according to a person familiar with the matter. Another related line of inquiry for Mr. Smith’s team is whether Mr. Trump misled one of his lawyers, M. Evan Corcoran, about the movement of classified documents around Mar-a-Lago. In June, Mr. Corcoran helped draft a sworn statement, signed by another lawyer, saying that a “diligent search” was conducted of the boxes and that any classified documents were turned over to the Justice Department.  During his appearance before the grand jury in March, Mr. Corcoran testified that several Trump employees had told him that the Mar-a-Lago storage room was the only place where the documents were kept, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The employees turned out to be wrong — when F.B.I. agents searched Mar-a-Lago in August they found classified documents in Mr. Trump’s office and residence — but at the time, that was a common belief within Mr. Trump’s inner circle. Although Mr. Corcoran testified that Mr. Trump did not personally convey that false information, his testimony hardly absolved the former president, the people with knowledge of the matter said. Mr. Corcoran also recounted to the grand jury how Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers of any other locations where the documents were stored, which may have effectively misled the legal team. Prosecutors working under Mr. Smith have developed what multiple people familiar with the investigation say is a wealth of testimony and evidence about Mr. Trump’s behavior during the lengthy period when the National Archives and the Justice Department sought to retrieve presidential materials from the former president. After months of requests, Mr. Trump in January 2022 turned over to the archives 15 boxes of material he had taken from the White House. Those boxes turned out to contain reams of classified material, prompting a Justice Department investigation and a subpoena in May of last year demanding the return of any further documents in Mr. Trump’s possession. Mr. Corcoran turned over another set of documents in response to the subpoena. But suspecting that Mr. Trump still had more based on witness testimony and video footage, prosecutors sought a search warrant, which the F.B.I. used to scour Mar-a-Lago in August, turning up more material despite the earlier statement from the lawyers saying they had found nothing else there.  The move backfired, as Mr. Nauta’s lawyers more or less cut off communication with the government. The decision to take an aggressive posture toward Mr. Nauta prompted internal concerns within the Justice Department. Some investigators believed that top prosecutors, including Jay Bratt, the head of the counterespionage section of the national security division at the Justice Department, had mishandled Mr. Nauta and cut off a chance to win his voluntary cooperation. More than six months later, prosecutors have still not charged Mr. Nauta or reached out to him to renew their conversation. Having gotten little from him as a witness, they are still seeking information from other witnesses about the movement of the boxes. In interviews recently, the Justice Department has been focused on Mr. Nauta and the help he received from a Mar-a-Lago maintenance worker in moving boxes. They have asked multiple people questions about it, as well as questions about the security cameras and what they did and did not capture. They have asked questions specifically about whether Mr. Nauta was walking to or from the president’s residence on the property, according to a person briefed on the matter. In addition to seeking testimony from the Calamaris and other Trump Organization employees, the special counsel’s office has issued numerous subpoenas to the company itself, seeking a variety of internal documents, according to people with knowledge of the subpoenas. Another line of inquiry that prosecutors have been pursuing relates to how Mr. Trump’s aides have helped hire and pay for lawyers representing some of the witnesses in investigations related to the former president. They have been trying to assess whether the witnesses were sized up for how much loyalty they might have to Mr. Trump as a condition of providing assistance, according to people briefed on the matter.',

					'Once upon a time, the legend goes, Theseus slew the Minotaur and sailed triumphantly home to Athens on a wooden ship. The vessel was preserved by Athenian citizens, who continually replaced its rotting planks with strong, fresh timber so a pilgrimage to Delos could be made each year in their hero’s name. Fascinated by this mythical tale, the philosopher Plutarch found it to embody a “logical question of things that grow”: After Theseus’s ship had been stripped of all its original material, could it still be considered the same ship? His question has caromed through centuries of Western thought. What if, Thomas Hobbes wondered, someone rustled up a second boat out of the discarded planks; would you now have two original vessels? And what about our own era of machine-made duplication — does replication strip away the soul of creation? Not long ago, I found myself wandering through Paris with a fake Celine handbag slung over my shoulder. In France, a country that prides itself on originating so much of the world’s fashion, punishments for counterfeiting are severe, to the point that I technically risked three years in prison just by carrying my little knockoff around. But the bag’s fraudulence was undetectable to human eyes. I was toting around a delicious, maddening secret: Like a ship remade with identical wood, the bag on my arm had been built on the same plan, with seemingly the same gleaming materials, as the “original.” Yet it was considered inauthentic, a trick, a cheat. My plunge into the world of fantastically realistic counterfeit purses — known as “superfakes” to vexed fashion houses and I.P. lawyers, or “unclockable reps” to their enthusiastic buyers — began a couple of years earlier, in what I might characterize as a spontaneous fit of lunacy. It was early 2021 when, thrown into sensory overload by grisly pandemic headlines, I found my gaze drifting guiltily to an advertisement in the right margin of a news site, where the model Kaia Gerber arched her arms lovingly around a Celine Triomphe — a plain, itty-bitty rectangular prism that in no universe could possibly be worth, as further research informed me, $2,200. I shut the tab, horrified. Having grown up a first-generation immigrant whose family’s idea of splurging was a monthly dinner at Pizza Hut, I refused to be the type of person who lusted over luxury handbags. I had always understood that these artifacts were not for me, in the way debutante balls or chartered Gulfstreams were not for me. But, days later and still mired in the quicksand of quarantine, I found myself cracking my laptop and Googling “buy Celine Triomphe cheap.” This led me to a Reddit community of replica enthusiasts, who traded details about “trusted sellers” capable of delivering a Chanel 2.55 or Loewe Puzzle or Hermès Birkin that promised to be indistinguishable from the original, and priced at a mere 5 percent or so of the M.S.R.P.  Where did these sensational counterfeits come from? Fake goods, as anyone who has ever strolled past the plasticky buffets on the Las Vegas Strip or Manhattan’s Canal Street can tell you, are nothing new or rare. But in the past decade or so, a new breed of knockoff purses has come onto the scene from China — boasting shockingly good quality and slipping through customs gates like sand through a sieve. And, as many an angry resale buyer can attest, they’re able to fool even the most well-trained eye. “It’s a pervasive, tremendous problem,” Bob Barchiesi, president of the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, told me. Hunter Thompson, who oversees the authentication process at the luxury consignment site the RealReal, elaborated: “It’s gotten to the point that you can see something in season replicated within that season.” What was once a sly novelty has bloomed into a gigantic market. In 2016, a Virginia woman was sentenced for buying $400,000 worth of designer purses from department stores, returning high-quality knockoffs and reselling the real bags for profit; the stores went years without catching on. Before the “Real Housewives” star Jen Shah pleaded guilty to telemarketing fraud last year, police raided her house and found shelves and shelves of fake Louis Vuittons mingled with authentic ones. In the pandemic, superfakes went supernova: A killer combo of quarantine malaise, frenzied stimulus-check hobby spending and the rise of sales via social-media sites like Instagram has propelled consumers’ awareness of — and fervor for — these hyperrealistic copycats to new heights. Now especially, in the face of rampant inflation, consumers coveting a $10,000 handbag who are advertised a $100 copycat hardly need an extra push. I WeChatted a seller calling herself Linda — a name that, amid others like Aadi, Aooko, Mr. Bao and Zippy, made her seem the least likely to scam me and/or get me placed on a C.I.A. watch list — and instantly she sent me photos of a dozen possible Triomphes. The seller reassured me that I’d have the chance to “QC” (quality-check) the “PSPs” (pre-shipment photos). A “high tier” version of the bag would come out to about 915 yuan, or $132. Which color would I like? I hesitated for a few days, then texted her: Cream, please. It was the middle of the night in China, but Linda wrote me back within seconds: Done. It would be at my doorstep in about three weeks.  Untangling the problem of duplication in the fashion industry is like trying to rewrap skeins of yarn. Designer houses spend billions fighting dupes, but even real Prada Cleos and Dior Book Totes are made with machines and templates — raising the question of what, exactly, is unique to an authentic bag. Is it simply a question of who gets to pocket the money? (Hermès recently mounted, and won, a trademark war against “MetaBirkin” NFTs.) Besides, replication is already threaded through the whole history of clothing. Before industrialization, and well before handbags were popularized as accessories, mimicry was essential to dressmaking: Rich women would observe in-vogue silhouettes, then direct their own seamstresses to duplicate the cuts, waistlines or sleeves. It wasn’t until the mass-production inventions of the 19th century that designers became paranoid about the riffraff’s being able to ape their status symbols. In 1951, the American writer Sally Iselin reported for The Atlantic on the pointedly snobbish shopping culture in Paris. But, she observed, while copyiste was a dirty word in France’s haute-couture circles, skilled tailors in Rome were more than happy to fit her with cheaper twins of the same ball gowns. In Iselin’s time, such boutiques were a guilty marvel; nowadays, shoppers don’t bat an eye at the idea of snapping up a Balenciaga silhouette from Zara, Shein or AliExpress. Even the superrich crave a good deal, as a Manhattan woman with a treasure trove of superfake Birkins confessed to The Cut last year. On the other side of the world in China — a country that is known for its fake-making and that had no compunctions about building a replica of the Gardens of Versailles — there are, by some estimates, as many as several million people who make a living delivering these good deals. I spoke with Kelly, one such person, seeking to peek under the hood of the shadowy business. (“Kelly” is not her real name; I’m referring to her here by the English moniker that she uses on WhatsApp. I contacted more than 30 different superfake-bag-sellers before one agreed to an interview.) Five years ago, Kelly worked in real estate in Shanghai, but she got fed up with trekking to an office every day. Now she works from home in Guangzhou, often hammering out a deal for a Gucci Dionysus or Fendi Baguette on her phone with one hand, wrangling lunch for her 8-year-old daughter with the other. Kelly finds the whole business of luxury bags — the sumptuous leather, razor-straight heat stamps, hand stitches, precocious metal mazes of prancing sangles and clochettes and boucles and fermoirs — “way too fussy,” she tells me in Chinese. But the work-life balance is great. As a sales rep for replicas, Kelly makes up to 30,000 yuan, or about $4,300, a month, though she has heard of A-listers who net up to 200,000 yuan a month — which would work out to roughly $350,000 a year. On a good day, Kelly can sell more than 30 gleaming Chloés and Yves Saint Laurents, to a client base of mostly American women. “If a bag can be recognized as fake,” she told me, “it’s not a worthwhile purchase for the customer, so I only sell bags that are high-quality but also enticingly affordable — $200 or $300 is the sweet spot.” Kelly keeps about 45 percent of each sale, out of which she pays for shipping, losses and other costs. The rest is wired to a network of manufacturers who divvy up proceeds to pay for overhead, materials and salaries. When a client agrees to order a bag from Kelly, she contacts a manufacturer, which arranges for a Birkin bag to roll out of the warehouse into an unmarked shipping box in a week or so. In Guangzhou, where a vast majority of the world’s superfakes are thought to originate, experts have identified two main reasons behind the illicit goods’ lightning-fast new speeds: sophistication in bag-making technology and in the bag-makers themselves. One such innovation in the latter is a disjointed, flat-string, hard-to-track supply chain. When the intellectual-property lawyer Harley Lewin was the subject of a New Yorker profile in 2007, he could often be found busting through hidden cellars on raids around the world. But increasingly, Lewin told me, “I’m sort of the guy in the spy novel who’s called ‘Control’ and sits in a room,” trying to sniff out “the bad guys” from screenshots of texts and D.M.s. Counterfeiting operations are no longer pyramid-shaped hierarchies with ever-higher bosses to roll: “Nowadays it’s a series of blocks, the financier and the designers and the manufacturers, and none of the blocks relate to each other,” Lewin explains. “So if you bust one block, odds are they can replace it in 10 minutes. The person you bust has very little information about who organizes what and where it goes.” Indeed, Kelly, even though she has sold every color variation of Louis Vuitton Neverfull under the sun, only handles bags in person on rare occasions to inspect quality. Sellers don’t stock inventory. They function as the consumer-facing marketing block, holding scant knowledge of how other blocks operate. Kelly just gets daily texts from a liaison at each outlet, letting her know of their output: “The factories won’t even tell us where they are.”  As for how the superfakes are achieving their unprecedented verisimilitude, Lewin, who has observed their factories from the inside, says it’s simply a combination of skillful artisanship and high-quality raw materials. Some superfake manufacturers travel to Italy to source from the same leather markets that the brands do; others buy the real bags to examine every stitch. Chinese authorities have little to no incentive to shut down these operations, given their contributions to local economies, the potential embarrassment to local ministers and the steady fraying of China’s political ties with the Western nations where savvy online buyers clamor for the goods. “They avoid taxes,” Lewin says. “The working conditions are terrible. But all of that goes to turning out a very high-quality fake at very low cost.” For replica enthusiasts on Reddit, “187 Factory” is legendary for its top-notch Chanel bags. It commands a premium of $600 for a caviar-leather quilted double-flap — pricier than a midtier $200 rep, but still far from the bag’s asking price at a Chanel boutique ($10,200) or on resale sites ($5,660 for one in “very good” condition on Fashionphile, $3,600 for one with “heavy scratches” and “noticeable balding” on the RealReal). But as Kelly describes it, “187 Factory” sounds like a branding ploy for what’s really just a well-organized chain of blocks, functionally indistinguishable from other miniature companies making premium knockoffs out of the same buckles and patterns. Kelly always lets clients know that she can get them equal-quality bags for less than what the 187 people charge. Still, many buyers insist they must have a “bag from 187.” Some have told Kelly that they’ve saved paychecks for months just to buy a 187 Chanel — in a curious echo of the fervent consumers doing the same for the authentic bags.  Those whose business it is to verify luxury bags insist, at least publicly, that there’s always a “tell” to a superfake. At the RealReal, where designer handbags go through rounds of scrutiny, including X-rays and measuring fonts down to the millimeter, Thompson told me that “sometimes, an item can be too perfect, too exacting, so you’ll look at it and know something is up.” And, he added, touch and smell can be giveaways. Rachel Vaisman, the company’s vice president of merchandising operations, said the company will contact law-enforcement officials if it suspects a consignor is sending in items with the intent to defraud. But one authenticator I spoke with confesses that it’s not always so clear-cut. The fakes “are getting so good, to the point that it comes down to inside etchings, or nine stitches instead of eight,” he told me. “Sometimes you really have no idea, and it becomes a time-consuming egg hunt, comparing photos on other websites and saying, ‘Does this hardware look like this one?’” (He asked to remain anonymous because he is not permitted to speak on behalf of his company.) He and his colleagues have their theories as to how the superfakes that come across their desks are so jaw-droppingly good: “We suspect it’s someone who maybe works at Chanel or Hermès who takes home real leathers. I think the really, really good ones have to be from people who work for the companies.” And every time a brand switches up its designs, as today’s fast-paced luxury houses are wont to do, authenticators find themselves in the dark again. Though U.S. officials try valiantly to sniff out impostor goods, too, seizing more than 300,000 fake bags and wallets in fiscal year 2022, the sheer volume of counterfeit imports — fakes in general are estimated to be a bustling, multibillion-dollar industry — means that authorities are able to inspect, on some estimates, as little as 5 percent of what comes in. For superfake sellers and buyers, those are great odds. After weeks, and hundreds of anxious Control-Rs on the DHL tracking page, and a daily pondering about what my mother might say when she encountered my mug shot on the evening news, my Celine Triomphe finally materialized — anticlimactically, in a manner much like anything else I’d ever ordered online. The box was lightly battered from having traveled through Abu Dhabi and, funnily enough, a network of shipping hubs across France and Italy before it landed in my lap in New York. I ripped open the tissue paper to extract the Triomphe, that glorious vessel, my purse of Theseus. By sight, nothing was detectable. I faithfully counted the stitches, measured dimensions. Underneath my hand, the leather did feel a bit stiff, rather less plush than the version I’d fondled for an unnecessary amount of time at Celine’s Soho boutique beforehand. But this giveaway, this “tell,” would graze against my shoulder and no one else’s.  A strange, complicated cloud of emotions engulfed me wherever I carried the bag. I contacted more sellers and bought more replicas, hoping to shake it loose. I toted a (rather fetching) $100 Gucci 1955 Horsebit rep through a vacation across Europe; I’ve worn the Triomphe to celebrity-flooded parties in Manhattan, finding myself preening under the approving, welcome-into-our-fold smiles of wealthy strangers. There is a smug superiority that comes with luxury bags — that’s sort of the point — but to my surprise, I found that this was even more the case with superfakes. Paradoxically, while there’s nothing more quotidian than a fake bag that comes out of a makeshift factory of nameless laborers studying how to replicate someone else’s idea, in another sense, there’s nothing more original. While a wardrobe might reveal something of the wearer’s personality and emotion, a luxury handbag is a hollow basin, expressing nothing individualistic at all. Instead, a handbag communicates certain ineffable ideas: money, status, the ability to move around in the world. And so, if you believe that fashion is inherently all about artifice — consider wink-wink items like Maison Margiela’s Replica sneaker, or the mind-​boggling profits of LVMH’s mass-produced luxury items — then there is an argument to be made that the superfake handbag, blunt and upfront to the buyer about its trickery, is the most honest, unvarnished item of all. I asked the writer Judith Thurman, whose sartorial insights I’ve always admired, about the name-brand handbag’s decades-long hold on women. Why do we yearn for very expensive sacks in the first place? Why do some buyers submit to thousand-dollar price hikes and risk bankruptcy for them? “It’s a kind of inclusive exclusiveness,” Thurman told me. “A handbag is a little treat, and it’s the only fashion item that is not sacrificial.” Clothes, with their unforgiving size tags and rigid shapes, can instill a cruel horror or disappointment in their wearers. Bags, meanwhile, dangle no shame, only delight. “There is an intangible sense when you are wearing something precious that makes you feel more precious yourself,” she theorizes. “And we all need — in this unbelievable age of cosmic insecurity — a little boost you can stick over your shoulder that makes you feel a bit more special than if you were wearing something that cost $24.99. It’s mass delusion, but the fashion business is about mass delusion. At what point does a mass delusion become a reality?” Thurman’s first designer-bag splurge was an Issey Miyake Bao Bao she bought for the full retail price of about $900. (“In buying that bag, I became an insane person.”) After it fell apart from wear, she couldn’t justify the price of another — and Issey Miyake had also stopped making her preferred model. So she went on Alibaba and bought two cheap replicas. “It was very strange,” Thurman says. “There was an aura to the real thing that the fake didn’t have. And if you ask me what does that mean, I really almost can’t say. Part of it was the spirit of going to the shop and paying more money than I could afford.” Volkan Yilmaz goes by Tanner Leatherstein on TikTok, where some 800,000 followers watch him slash and tear popular silhouettes from Chanel or Louis Vuitton apart at the seams to assess whether the quality of any given handbag is “worth it” from a quality and craftsmanship perspective. (Spoiler: Very rarely so. With the exception of Bottega Veneta or Hermès.) “A luxury bag’s cost is never about its material,” Yilmaz told me. That the profits of one idea’s relentless duplications funnel only into one (fat, corporate) pocket is precisely why many younger consumers see fake bags as better than the real thing. To them, counterfeit luxury — in a world already awash in lower-priced “dupes” of every kind, from eye shadows to electronics — is not an unethical scandal but a big, joyful open secret. Replica communities laugh at big luxury firms, taking on a subversive, stick-it-to-the-man attitude. A handbag “is a mass-produced item — it’s not a piece hanging in a museum,” Kirstin Chen, who was inspired to write her novel “Counterfeit” by the Virginia woman who scammed department stores, said to me. Jordan T. Alexander, a 29-year-old TikTok creator who has made videos about replica bags, told me she sometimes thinks of them as “the democratization of fashion.” Trina, a woman who sells imported replicas to customers in Las Vegas and requested to be identified only by her first name, sees the most passion for fakes among middle-class women of color who seem emboldened to find themselves with access to a different world: “A bag gives a woman a more classy demeanor. The woman who is walking out of Target, getting in their vehicle or whatever, feeling good? That’s what it’s all about.” In the face of widening wealth disparity around the globe, it’s no longer fashionable anyway to gate-keep expensive things. The actress Jane Birkin, who lent her name to Hermès’s crown jewel, shrugs at fake Birkins: “It’s very nice that everyone’s got one or wants one,” she told Vogue in 2011. “If people want to go for the real thing, fine. If they go for copies, that’s fine, too. I really don’t think it matters.” The first recorded instance of the English word “snob” dates back to 18th-century cobblers, and was soon used in reference to any person of low rank. (One rumor, though unsubstantiated, pins the etymology to the Latin phrase sine nobilitate, or “without nobility.”) According to the Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins, university students snickered at the lowly “snobs” outside their gates, and the word eventually came to describe people who tried to mimic their more well-to-do neighbors — early templates of today’s schemers, scammers, wannabes — only for the word to come to define this elite group’s own high-class arrogance.',

The vessel was preserved by Athenian citizens, who continually replaced its rotting planks with strong, fresh timber so a pilgrimage to Delos could be made each year in their hero’s name. Fascinated by this mythical tale, the philosopher Plutarch found it to embody a “logical question of things that grow”: After Theseus’s ship had been stripped of all its original material, could it still be considered the same ship? His question has caromed through centuries of Western thought. What if, Thomas Hobbes wondered, someone rustled up a second boat out of the discarded planks; would you now have two original vessels? And what about our own era of machine-made duplication — does replication strip away the soul of creation?</p><p>Not long ago, I found myself wandering through Paris with a fake Celine handbag slung over my shoulder. In France, a country that prides itself on originating so much of the world’s fashion, punishments for counterfeiting are severe, to the point that I technically risked three years in prison just by carrying my little knockoff around. But the bag’s fraudulence was undetectable to human eyes. I was toting around a delicious, maddening secret: Like a ship remade with identical wood, the bag on my arm had been built on the same plan, with seemingly the same gleaming materials, as the “original.” Yet it was considered inauthentic, a trick, a cheat.</p><p>My plunge into the world of fantastically realistic counterfeit purses — known as “superfakes” to vexed fashion houses and I.P. lawyers, or “unclockable reps” to their enthusiastic buyers — began a couple of years earlier, in what I might characterize as a spontaneous fit of lunacy. It was early 2021 when, thrown into sensory overload by grisly pandemic headlines, I found my gaze drifting guiltily to an advertisement in the right margin of a news site, where the model Kaia Gerber arched her arms lovingly around a Celine Triomphe — a plain, itty-bitty rectangular prism that in no universe could possibly be worth, as further research informed me, $2,200.</p><p>I shut the tab, horrified. Having grown up a first-generation immigrant whose family’s idea of splurging was a monthly dinner at Pizza Hut, I refused to be the type of person who lusted over luxury handbags. I had always understood that these artifacts were not for me, in the way debutante balls or chartered Gulfstreams were not for me. But, days later and still mired in the quicksand of quarantine, I found myself cracking my laptop and Googling “buy Celine Triomphe cheap.” This led me to a Reddit community of replica enthusiasts, who traded details about “trusted sellers” capable of delivering a Chanel 2.55 or Loewe Puzzle or Hermès Birkin that promised to be indistinguishable from the original, and priced at a mere 5 percent or so of the M.S.R.P.</p></div><div><p></p><h2 id="link-783e1b72">Take the Superfakes Quiz!</h2><p></p></div><div data-source-id="100000008881001" data-id="100000008881001" data-sourceid="100000008881001" data-asset-type="default" data-build-version="6.0.20" id="superfake-quiz"><p>Which Chanel is real? Click your guess:</p></div><div><p>Where did these sensational counterfeits come from? Fake goods, as anyone who has ever strolled past the plasticky buffets on the Las Vegas Strip or Manhattan’s Canal Street can tell you, are nothing new or rare. But in the past decade or so, a new breed of knockoff purses has come onto the scene from China — boasting shockingly good quality and slipping through customs gates like sand through a sieve. And, as many an angry resale buyer <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2019/10/23/if-fake-bags-are-being-sold-on-the-realreal-how-can-the-resale-business-ever-succeed/?sh=334dcf2c6acb">can attest</a>, they’re able to fool even the most well-trained eye. “It’s a pervasive, tremendous problem,” Bob Barchiesi, president of the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, told me. Hunter Thompson, who oversees the authentication process at the luxury consignment site the RealReal, elaborated: “It’s gotten to the point that you can see something in season replicated within that season.”</p><p>What was once a sly novelty has bloomed into a gigantic market. In 2016, a Virginia woman was sentenced for buying $400,000 worth of designer purses from department stores, returning high-quality knockoffs and reselling the real bags for profit; the stores <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/arlington-woman-sentenced-counterfeit-handbag-scheme">went years without catching on</a>. Before the “Real Housewives” star Jen Shah pleaded guilty to telemarketing fraud last year, police raided her house and found shelves and shelves of fake Louis Vuittons mingled with authentic ones. In the pandemic, superfakes went supernova: A killer combo of quarantine malaise, frenzied stimulus-check hobby spending and the rise of sales via social-media sites like Instagram has propelled consumers’ awareness of — and fervor for — these hyperrealistic copycats to new heights. Now especially, in the face of rampant inflation, consumers coveting a $10,000 handbag who are advertised a $100 copycat hardly need an extra push.</p><p>I WeChatted a seller calling herself Linda — a name that, amid others like Aadi, Aooko, Mr. Bao and Zippy, made her seem the least likely to scam me and/or get me placed on a C.I.A. watch list — and instantly she sent me photos of a dozen possible Triomphes. The seller reassured me that I’d have the chance to “QC” (quality-check) the “PSPs” (pre-shipment photos). A “high tier” version of the bag would come out to about 915 yuan, or $132. Which color would I like?</p><p>I hesitated for a few days, then texted her: Cream, please. It was the middle of the night in China, but Linda wrote me back within seconds: Done. It would be at my doorstep in about three weeks.</p></div><div><p><strong>Untangling the problem </strong>of duplication in the fashion industry is like trying to rewrap skeins of yarn. Designer houses spend billions fighting dupes, but even real Prada Cleos and Dior Book Totes are made with machines and templates — raising the question of what, exactly, is unique to an authentic bag. Is it simply a question of who gets to pocket the money? (Hermès recently mounted, and won, a trademark war against “MetaBirkin” NFTs.)</p><p>Besides, replication is already threaded through the whole history of clothing. Before industrialization, and well before handbags were popularized as accessories, mimicry was essential to dressmaking: Rich women would observe in-vogue silhouettes, then direct their own seamstresses to duplicate the cuts, waistlines or sleeves. It wasn’t until the mass-production inventions of the 19th century that designers became paranoid about the riffraff’s being able to ape their status symbols. In 1951, the American writer Sally Iselin <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1951/09/i-bought-a-dress-in-paris/640622/">reported for The Atlantic</a> on the pointedly snobbish shopping culture in Paris. But, she observed, while <em>copyiste</em> was a dirty word in France’s haute-couture circles, skilled tailors in Rome were more than happy to fit her with cheaper twins of the same ball gowns.</p><p>In Iselin’s time, such boutiques were a guilty marvel; nowadays, shoppers don’t bat an eye at the idea of snapping up a Balenciaga silhouette from Zara, Shein or AliExpress. Even the superrich crave a good deal, as a Manhattan woman with a treasure trove of superfake Birkins <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/04/repladies-fake-luxury-bags.html">confessed to The Cut</a> last year. On the other side of the world in China — a country that is known for its fake-making and that had no compunctions about building a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/fake-paris-china/index.html">replica of the Gardens of Versailles</a> — there are, by some estimates, as many as several million people who make a living delivering these good deals.</p><p>I spoke with Kelly, one such person, seeking to peek under the hood of the shadowy business. (“Kelly” is not her real name; I’m referring to her here by the English moniker that she uses on WhatsApp. I contacted more than 30 different superfake-bag-sellers before one agreed to an interview.) Five years ago, Kelly worked in real estate in Shanghai, but she got fed up with trekking to an office every day. Now she works from home in Guangzhou, often hammering out a deal for a Gucci Dionysus or Fendi Baguette on her phone with one hand, wrangling lunch for her 8-year-old daughter with the other. Kelly finds the whole business of luxury bags — the sumptuous leather, razor-straight heat stamps, hand stitches, precocious metal mazes of prancing <em>sangles</em> and <em>clochettes</em> and <em>boucles</em> and <em>fermoirs</em> — “way too fussy,” she tells me in Chinese. But the work-life balance is great. As a sales rep for replicas, Kelly makes up to 30,000 yuan, or about $4,300, a month, though she has heard of A-listers who net up to 200,000 yuan a month — which would work out to roughly $350,000 a year.</p><p>On a good day, Kelly can sell more than 30 gleaming Chloés and Yves Saint Laurents, to a client base of mostly American women. “If a bag can be recognized as fake,” she told me, “it’s not a worthwhile purchase for the customer, so I only sell bags that are high-quality but also enticingly affordable — $200 or $300 is the sweet spot.” Kelly keeps about 45 percent of each sale, out of which she pays for shipping, losses and other costs. The rest is wired to a network of manufacturers who divvy up proceeds to pay for overhead, materials and salaries. When a client agrees to order a bag from Kelly, she contacts a manufacturer, which arranges for a Birkin bag to roll out of the warehouse into an unmarked shipping box in a week or so.</p></div><div><p>In Guangzhou, where a vast majority of the world’s superfakes are thought to originate, experts have identified two main reasons behind the illicit goods’ lightning-fast new speeds: sophistication in bag-making technology and in the bag-makers themselves.</p><p>One such innovation in the latter is a disjointed, flat-string, hard-to-track supply chain.

But as Kelly describes it, “187 Factory” sounds like a branding ploy for what’s really just a well-organized chain of blocks, functionally indistinguishable from other miniature companies making premium knockoffs out of the same buckles and patterns. Kelly always lets clients know that she can get them equal-quality bags for less than what the 187 people charge. Still, many buyers insist they must have a “bag from 187.” Some have told Kelly that they’ve saved paychecks for months just to buy a 187 Chanel — in a curious echo of the fervent consumers doing the same for the authentic bags.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure role="group" aria-label="media"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/07/magazine/07mag-Superfake-images-02/07mag-Superfake-images-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600" media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/07/magazine/07mag-Superfake-images-02/07mag-Superfake-images-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200" media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/07/magazine/07mag-Superfake-images-02/07mag-Superfake-images-02-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800" media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)"><img height="800" width="600" decoding="async" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/07/magazine/07mag-Superfake-images-02/07mag-Superfake-images-02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/07/magazine/07mag-Superfake-images-02/07mag-Superfake-images-02-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 768w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/07/magazine/07mag-Superfake-images-02/07mag-Superfake-images-02-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1536w" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/07/magazine/07mag-Superfake-images-02/07mag-Superfake-images-02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" alt="A Chanel handbag is pictured side-by-side with a replica."></picture></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">On the left, a Chanel Classic handbag.

Set designer: Jo Jo Li.</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Those whose business it is to verify luxury bags insist, at least publicly, that there’s always a “tell” to a superfake. At the RealReal, where designer handbags go through rounds of scrutiny, including X-rays and measuring fonts down to the millimeter, Thompson told me that “sometimes, an item can be <em>too</em> perfect, <em>too</em> exacting, so you’ll look at it and know something is up.” And, he added, touch and smell can be giveaways. Rachel Vaisman, the company’s vice president of merchandising operations, said the company will contact law-enforcement officials if it suspects a consignor is sending in items with the intent to defraud.</p></div><div><p>But one authenticator I spoke with confesses that it’s not always so clear-cut. The fakes “are getting so good, to the point that it comes down to inside etchings, or nine stitches instead of eight,” he told me. “Sometimes you really have no idea, and it becomes a time-consuming egg hunt, comparing photos on other websites and saying, ‘Does this hardware look like this one?’” (He asked to remain anonymous because he is not permitted to speak on behalf of his company.) He and his colleagues have their theories as to how the superfakes that come across their desks are so jaw-droppingly good: “We suspect it’s someone who maybe works at Chanel or Hermès who takes home real leathers. I think the really, really good ones have to be from people who work for the companies.” And every time a brand switches up its designs, as today’s fast-paced luxury houses are wont to do, authenticators find themselves in the dark again.</p><p>Though U.S. officials try valiantly to sniff out impostor goods, too, seizing more than 300,000 fake bags and wallets in fiscal year 2022, the sheer volume of counterfeit imports — fakes in general are estimated to be a bustling, multibillion-dollar industry — means that authorities are able to inspect, on some estimates, as little as 5 percent of what comes in. For superfake sellers and buyers, those are great odds.</p><p><strong>After weeks, and </strong>hundreds of anxious Control-Rs on the DHL tracking page, and a daily pondering about what my mother might say when she encountered my mug shot on the evening news, my Celine Triomphe finally materialized — anticlimactically, in a manner much like anything else I’d ever ordered online. The box was lightly battered from having traveled through Abu Dhabi and, funnily enough, a network of shipping hubs across France and Italy before it landed in my lap in New York. I ripped open the tissue paper to extract the Triomphe, that glorious vessel, my purse of Theseus. By sight, nothing was detectable. I faithfully counted the stitches, measured dimensions. Underneath my hand, the leather did feel a bit stiff, rather less plush than the version I’d fondled for an unnecessary amount of time at Celine’s Soho boutique beforehand. But this giveaway, this “tell,” would graze against my shoulder and no one else’s.</p><p>A strange, complicated cloud of emotions engulfed me wherever I carried the bag. I contacted more sellers and bought more replicas, hoping to shake it loose. I toted a (rather fetching) $100 Gucci 1955 Horsebit rep through a vacation across Europe; I’ve worn the Triomphe to celebrity-flooded parties in Manhattan, finding myself preening under the approving, welcome-into-our-fold smiles of wealthy strangers. There is a smug superiority that comes with luxury bags — that’s sort of the point — but to my surprise, I found that this was even more the case with superfakes. Paradoxically, while there’s nothing more quotidian than a fake bag that comes out of a makeshift factory of nameless laborers studying how to replicate someone else’s idea, in another sense, there’s nothing more original.</p></div><div><p>While a wardrobe might reveal something of the wearer’s personality and emotion, a luxury handbag is a hollow basin, expressing nothing individualistic at all. Instead, a handbag communicates certain ineffable ideas: money, status, the ability to move around in the world. And so, if you believe that fashion is inherently all about artifice — consider wink-wink items like Maison Margiela’s Replica sneaker, or the mind-​boggling profits of LVMH’s mass-produced luxury items — then there is an argument to be made that the superfake handbag, blunt and upfront to the buyer about its trickery, is the most honest, unvarnished item of all.</p><p>I asked the writer Judith Thurman, whose sartorial insights I’ve always admired, about the name-brand handbag’s decades-long hold on women. Why do we yearn for very expensive sacks in the first place? Why do some buyers submit to thousand-dollar price hikes and risk bankruptcy for them? “It’s a kind of inclusive exclusiveness,” Thurman told me. “A handbag is a little treat, and it’s the only fashion item that is not sacrificial.” Clothes, with their unforgiving size tags and rigid shapes, can instill a cruel horror or disappointment in their wearers. Bags, meanwhile, dangle no shame, only delight. “There is an intangible sense when you are wearing something precious that makes you feel more precious yourself,” she theorizes. “And we all need — in this unbelievable age of cosmic insecurity — a little boost you can stick over your shoulder that makes you feel a bit more special than if you were wearing something that cost $24.99. It’s mass delusion, but the fashion business is about mass delusion. At what point does a mass delusion become a reality?”</p><p>Thurman’s first designer-bag splurge was an Issey Miyake Bao Bao she bought for the full retail price of about $900. (“In buying that bag, I became an insane person.”) After it fell apart from wear, she couldn’t justify the price of another — and Issey Miyake had also stopped making her preferred model. So she went on Alibaba and bought two cheap replicas. “It was very strange,” Thurman says. “There was an aura to the real thing that the fake didn’t have. And if you ask me what does that mean, I really almost can’t say. Part of it was the spirit of going to the shop and paying more money than I could afford.”</p><p>Volkan Yilmaz goes by Tanner Leatherstein on TikTok, where some 800,000 followers watch him slash and tear popular silhouettes from Chanel or Louis Vuitton apart at the seams to assess whether the quality of any given handbag is “worth it” from a quality and craftsmanship perspective. (Spoiler: Very rarely so. With the exception of Bottega Veneta or Hermès.) “A luxury bag’s cost is never about its material,” Yilmaz told me.</p><p>That the profits of one idea’s relentless duplications funnel only into one (fat, corporate) pocket is precisely why many younger consumers see fake bags as <em>better</em> than the real thing. To them, counterfeit luxury — in a world already awash in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stefficao/dupe-parody-tiktok-trend">lower-priced “dupes”</a> of every kind, from eye shadows to electronics — is not an unethical scandal but a big, joyful open secret. Replica communities laugh at big luxury firms, taking on a subversive, stick-it-to-the-man attitude. A handbag “is a mass-produced item — it’s not a piece hanging in a museum,” Kirstin Chen, who was inspired to write her novel “Counterfeit” by the Virginia woman who scammed department stores, said to me. Jordan T. Alexander, a 29-year-old TikTok creator who has made videos about replica bags, told me she sometimes thinks of them as “the democratization of fashion.” Trina, a woman who sells imported replicas to customers in Las Vegas and requested to be identified only by her first name, sees the most passion for fakes among middle-class women of color who seem emboldened to find themselves with access to a different world: “A bag gives a woman a more classy demeanor. The woman who is walking out of Target, getting in their vehicle or whatever, feeling good? That’s what it’s all about.”</p></div><div><p>In the face of widening wealth disparity around the globe, it’s no longer fashionable anyway to gate-keep expensive things. The actress Jane Birkin, who lent her name to Hermès’s crown jewel, shrugs at fake Birkins: “It’s very nice that everyone’s got one or wants one,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.vogue.com/article/jane-birkins-birkin-buy-it-now">told Vogue</a> in 2011. “If people want to go for the real thing, fine. If they go for copies, that’s fine, too. I really don’t think it matters.” The first recorded instance of the English word “snob” dates back to 18th-century cobblers, and was soon used in reference to any person of low rank. (One rumor, though unsubstantiated, pins the etymology to the Latin phrase sine <em>nobilitate</em>, or “without nobility.”) According to the Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins, university students snickered at the lowly “snobs” outside their gates, and the word eventually came to describe people who tried to mimic their more well-to-do neighbors — early templates of today’s schemers, scammers, wannabes — only for the word to come to define this elite group’s own high-class arrogance.</p><p>Was I a snob in the original sense or the contemporary one? I’d been drawn to multithousand-dollar designer bags because they felt so elusive and unavailable, but now that they, via superfakes, had become available to me, I no longer really wanted them; the pursuit of them had started to feel, I realized at some point, marvelously worthless.</p><p>I asked Kelly what she thought about her clients and their obsessive yearning for these brilliant, mundane, often aesthetically unimaginative tiny objects. I yearned for her to unfurl my unease, to rip open the secret seams and expose something profound.</p><p>“You know, there’s an old saying in Chinese,” Kelly told me.</p><p>I thought she was about to recite a fragment of an ancient poem, or to synthesize the joy and genius of superfakes into some wonderful proverb that could reconcile our collective love of duplicity with our human insistence on realism. But Kelly, practical, business-minded and raised on a different side of the world, didn’t find my loose-ended Western anxieties all that interesting. Or maybe she had misunderstood what I was asking. Kelly went on: “The saying is, ‘You always get what you pay for.’”</p><hr></div><div><p>Grant Cornett is an artist who resides in the Catskill Mountains.

					'As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.  Investors are not convinced that regional banks including PacWest and Western Alliance can remain viable. Some are actively betting on their demise.  A cluster of regional banks scrambled on Thursday to convince the public of their financial soundness, even as their stock prices plunged and investors took bets on which might be the next to fall. The tumult brought questions about the future of the lenders to the fore, suggesting a new phase in the crisis that began two months ago with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and was punctuated on Monday by the seizure and sale of First Republic Bank. PacWest and Western Alliance were in the eye of the storm, despite the companies’ protestations that their finances were solid. PacWest’s shares lost 50 percent of their value on Thursday and Western Alliance fell 38 percent. Other midsize banks, including Zions and Comerica, also posted double-digit percentage declines. Unlike the banks that failed after depositors rushed to pull their money out, the lenders now under pressure have reported relatively stable deposit bases and don’t sit on mountains of soured loans. They are also much smaller than Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic, which each had about $200 billion in assets when they collapsed. PacWest, based in Los Angeles, has about $40 billion in assets, and Western Alliance, with headquarters in Phoenix, has $65 billion in assets. Both banks run fewer than 100 branches.  The most immediate threat the banks face, analysts said, is a crisis of confidence. Headlines about their spiraling share prices could spook depositors and upend the banks’ ability to operate normally. “How do we get out of this?” said Christopher McGratty, head of U.S. bank research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “I think we’re still searching for that answer.” Shares of PacWest and Western Alliance were halted for trading dozens of times on Thursday as their huge price swings breached stock-exchange guardrails put in place to prevent a sell-off from spiraling out of control. The turmoil also raised the specter of concerted action by short sellers, the traders who bet on share prices falling and are sometimes blamed for stoking market volatility. The Biden administration was closely monitoring the markets, “including the short-selling pressures on healthy banks,” the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, told reporters on Thursday. Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a statement about market conditions that the agency was “focused on identifying and prosecuting any form of misconduct that might threaten investors, capital formation or the markets more broadly.” Justin D’Ercole, a founder of ISO-mts Capital Management, a bank-focused fund, said the trading on Thursday felt “exceptionally panicky” and “overdone.”  “There was extreme anxiety about these banks without a lot of reasoning,” he said. The trading was a reminder that the crisis may yet continue, belying predictions that the situation would be calmer after JPMorgan Chase came to an agreement with government officials to acquire the ailing First Republic. Regulators agreed to assume billions of dollars of potential losses lurking on First Republic’s books, and JPMorgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, declared immediately after the acquisition that “this part of the crisis is over.” On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, said during a news conference that conditions had calmed since Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, noting that it and the two other failed banks “at the heart of the stress” had been resolved. Hours later, PacWest’s shares began their latest nosedive.  “Institutional investors have lost confidence in banks,” said Julian Wellesley, a bank analyst at Loomis Sayles. “I hear from a lot people that the share prices don’t make sense but still no one wants to come in and buy.” That’s disconcerting for the banks themselves, indicating that their claims of sound financial health have yet to achieve the desired impact. There is a limit to how long any public company can limp along with a cratering stock price before creating fear among depositors and drawing ire from shareholders. Even before this week’s commotion, depositors were increasingly worried about the safety of their money, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. According to a Gallup poll conducted through late April, 48 percent of U.S. adults said they were concerned about the money they held in deposits at financial institutions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which guarantees bank accounts up to $250,000, this week released a report saying it would consider changes to its rules. The agency suggested that it might try to provide higher levels of insurance to business payment accounts, which would allow businesses to feel comfortable continuing to pay workers without creating the “moral hazard” problems that could happen if all deposits were broadly guaranteed.  It would require legislation from Congress to amend the current deposit insurance system. Amid the relentless stock declines, some blamed a different boogeyman: Investors who bet on a fall in the price of a stock. Short sellers have made nearly $7 billion this year betting against regional banks, according to estimates by S3 Partners, a data provider, and can direct those profits toward new targets. PacWest appeared most squarely in their cross hairs, for the moment at least. Almost 20 percent of the bank’s shares are currently on loan to short sellers, who sell them and hope to buy them back later when the stock has fallen, according to data from S3. Nearly 8 percent of Western Alliance’s shares are similarly lent out. Before First Republic was seized, over 36 percent of its shares were out on loan. On Thursday, Western Alliance blamed those short sellers for the turmoil, suggesting they were behind “false narratives about a financially sound and profitable bank,” as it issued a statement denying a report that it was considering a sale. Such attacks rarely work against short sellers, and the banks’ disclosures, on Wednesday and Thursday, detailing that their depositors weren’t fleeing and that their capital base was sound, didn’t seem to either.',

					'Increasingly, it is not safe to be in public, to be human, to be fallible. I’m not quoting breathless journalism about rising crime or conservative talking points about America falling into ruin. The ruin I’m thinking of isn’t in San Francisco or Chicago or at the southern border. The ruin is woven into the fabric of America. It’s seeping into all of us. All across the country, supposedly good, upstanding citizens are often fatally enforcing ever-changing, arbitrary and personal norms for how we conduct ourselves. In Kansas City, Mo., Ralph Yarl, a Black 16-year-old, rang the wrong doorbell. He was trying to pick up his younger brothers and was simply on the wrong street, Northeast 115th Street instead of Northeast 115th Terrace, a harmless mistake. Andrew Lester, 84 and white, shot him twice and said, according to Ralph, “Don’t come around here.” Bleeding and injured, Ralph went to three different houses, according to a family member, before those good neighbors in a good, middle-class neighborhood helped him. In upstate New York, a 20-year-old woman, Kaylin Gillis, was looking for a friend’s house in a rural area. The driver of the car she was in turned into a driveway and the homeowner, Kevin Monahan, 65, is accused of firing twice at the car and killing Ms. Gillis. In Illinois, William Martys was using a leaf blower in his yard. A neighbor, Ettore Lacchei, allegedly started an argument with Mr. Martys and, the police say, killed him.  Two cheerleaders were shot in a Texas parking lot after one, Heather Roth, got into the wrong car. One of her teammates, Payton Washington, was also shot. Both girls survived, with injuries. In Cleveland, Texas, a father asked his neighbor Francisco Oropesa to stop shooting his gun on his porch because his baby was trying to sleep. Mr. Oropesa walked over to the father’s house and has been charged with killing five people, including an 8-year-old boy, with an AR-15-style rifle. Two of the slain adults were found covering children, who survived. At a Walgreens in Nashville, Mitarius Boyd suspected that Travonsha Ferguson, who was seven months pregnant, was shoplifting. Instead of calling the police, he followed Ms. Ferguson and her friend into the parking lot and, after one of the women sprayed mace in his face, according to Mr. Boyd, began firing. Ms. Ferguson was rushed to the hospital, where she had an emergency C-section and her baby was born two months early. And sometimes there is no gun. On Monday, Jordan Neely, a Michael Jackson impersonator experiencing homelessness, was yelling and, according to some subway riders, acting aggressively on an F train in New York City. “I don’t have food, I don’t have a drink, I’m fed up,” Mr. Neely cried out. “I don’t mind going to jail and getting life in prison. I’m ready to die.” Was he making people uncomfortable? I’m sure he was. But his were the words of a man in pain. He did not physically harm anyone. And the consequence for causing discomfort isn’t death unless, of course, it is. A former Marine held Mr. Neely in a chokehold for several minutes, killing the man. News reports keep saying Mr. Neely died, which is a passive thing. We die of old age. We die in a car accident. We die from disease. When someone holds us in a chokehold for several minutes, something far worse has occurred. A man actively brought about Mr. Neely’s death. No one appears to have intervened during those minutes to help Mr. Neely, though two men apparently tried to help the former Marine. Did anyone ask the former Marine to release Mr. Neely from his chokehold? The people in that subway car prioritized their own discomfort and anxiety over Mr. Neely’s distress. All of the people in that subway car on Monday will have to live with their apparent inaction and indifference. Now that it’s too late, there are haunting, heartbreaking images of Mr. Neely, helpless and pinned, still being choked. How does something like this happen? How does this senseless, avoidable violence happen? Truly, how? We all need to ask ourselves that question until we come up with an acceptable answer.  In the immediate aftermath, the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, couldn’t set politics aside and acknowledge how horrific Mr. Neely’s death was. Mr. Adams said: “Any loss of life is tragic. There’s a lot we don’t know about what happened here.” His was a bland and impotent statement, even though the sequence of events seems pretty clear and was corroborated by video, photography and a witness. And while any loss is in fact tragic, this specific loss, the death of Jordan Neely, was barely addressed. Mr. Adams didn’t bother to say Mr. Neely’s name and went on to equivocate about his administration’s investments in mental health, a strange claim to make while allowing first responders in New York City to involuntarily commit people experiencing mental health crises. Each of these innocent people who lost their lives was in the wrong place at the wrong time. In most cases, armed assailants deputized themselves to stand their ground or enforce justice for a petty crime. Some claimed self-defense, said they were afraid, though some of their victims were unarmed women and children. We have to ask the uncomfortable questions: Why are men so afraid? Why are they so fragile that they shoot or harm first and ask questions later? Why do they believe death or injury is an appropriate response to human fallibility? Public life shared with terrified and/or entitled and/or angry and/or disaffected men is untenable. We are at something of an impasse. The list of things that can get you killed in public is expanding every single day. Whether it’s mass shootings or police brutality or random acts of violence, it only takes running into one scared man to have the worst and likely last day of your life. We can’t even agree on right and wrong anymore. Instead of addressing actual problems, like homelessness and displacement, lack of physical and mental health care, food scarcity, poverty, lax gun laws and more, we bury our heads in the sand. Only when this unchecked violence comes to our doorstep do we maybe care enough to try to effect change. There is no patience for simple mistakes or room for addressing how bigotry colors even the most innocuous interactions. There is no regard for due process. People who deem themselves judge, jury and executioner walk among us, and we have no real way of knowing when they will turn on us. I will be thinking about Jordan Neely in particular for a long time. I will be thinking about who gets to stand his ground, who doesn’t, and how, all too often, it’s people in the latter group who are buried beneath that ground by those who refuse to cede dominion over it. Every single day there are news stories that are individually devastating and collectively an unequivocal condemnation of what we are becoming: a people without empathy, without any respect for the sanctity of life unless it’s our own.  It’s easy, on social media, to say, “I would have done something to help Mr. Neely.” It’s easy to imagine we would have called for help, offered him some food or money, extended him the grace and empathy we all deserve. It’s so very easy to think we are good, empathetic people. But time and time again, people like us, who think so highly of themselves, have the opportunity to stand up and do the right thing, and they don’t. What on earth makes us think that, when the time comes, we will be any different?',

					'Is a gay Republican Latino more capable of conducting a physics experiment than a white progressive heterosexual woman? Would they come to different conclusions based on the same data because of their different backgrounds? For most people, the suggestion isn’t just ludicrous; it’s offensive. Yet this belief — that science is somehow subjective and should be practiced and judged accordingly — has recently taken hold in academic, governmental and medical settings. A paper published last week, “In Defense of Merit in Science,” documents the disquieting ways in which research is increasingly informed by a politicized agenda, one that often characterizes science as fundamentally racist and in need of “decolonizing.” The authors argue that science should instead be independent, evidence-based and focused on advancing knowledge. Yet the paper was rejected by several prominent mainstream journals, including The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Another publication that passed on the paper, the authors report, described some of its conclusions as “downright hurtful.” The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences took issue with the word “merit” in the title, writing that “the problem is that this concept of merit, as the authors surely know, has been widely and legitimately attacked as hollow as currently implemented.” Instead, the paper has been published in a new journal called — you can’t make this up — The Journal of Controversial Ideas. The journal, which welcomes papers that “discuss well-known controversial topics from diverse cultural, philosophical, moral, political and religious perspectives,” was co-founded in 2021 by the philosopher Peter Singer and is entirely serious. This particular paper was rewritten multiple times and peer-reviewed before publication. However controversial one judges the paper’s claims, they deserve consideration.  According to its 29 authors, who are primarily scientists (including two Nobel laureates) in fields as varied as theoretical physics, psychology and pharmacokinetics, ideological concerns are threatening independence and rigor in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine. Though the goal of expanding opportunity for more diverse researchers in the sciences is laudable, the authors write, it should not be pursued at the expense of foundational scientific concepts like objective truth, merit and evidence, which they claim are being jeopardized by efforts to account for differing perspectives. Consider the increasingly widespread practice of appending a “positionality statement” to one’s research. This is an explicit acknowledgment by the author of an academic paper of his or her identity (e.g., “nondisabled,” “continuing generation”). Positionality statements were first popular in the social sciences and are now spreading to the hard sciences and medicine. The idea is that one’s race, sex, relative privilege and “experiences of oppression” inherently inform one’s research, especially in ways that perpetuate or alleviate bias. But whatever validity “alternative ways of knowing,” “multiple narratives” and “lived experience” may have in the humanities, they are of questionable utility when it comes to the sciences. Some defenders of positionality statements maintain that these acknowledgments promote objectivity by drawing attention to a researcher’s potential blind spots, but in practice they can have the opposite effect, implying that scientific research isn’t universally valid or applicable — that there are different kinds of knowledge for different groups of people. Another concern is the rise of “citation justice” — the attempt to achieve racial or gender balance in scholarly references. The purpose of a citation in an academic publication is to substantiate claims and offer the most relevant supporting research. Advocates of citation justice say these citations too often prioritize the work of white men. But in a field like chemistry, in which fewer than 30 percent of papers are written by women, according to data from the American Chemical Society, and where the foundational texts are almost entirely written by men, “justice” means disproportionately favoring studies by women, regardless of relevance. Many prominent science journals now recommend that before submission, authors run their papers through software programs that detect any citation bias. A third worrisome development is the statements that researchers are often required to write in order to apply for faculty jobs (and to advance in those positions) describing their commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, something my colleague John McWhorter, one of the paper’s authors, has written about in The Times. These are noble goals that in practice, however, can amount to discrimination, and such statements strike many as a kind of political litmus test. At the University of California, Berkeley, for example, in the hiring cycle from 2018 to 2019, three-quarters of applicants for a set of five faculty positions in the life sciences were eliminated on the basis of these statements alone. (Grant programs also often require applications for funding in the sciences to include D.E.I. goals.)  Of course, nobody wants to hire a racist. But that’s not what we’re talking about. For a prospective faculty member to say he is determined to treat all students equally rather than to advance diversity initiatives can be enough to count someone out of a job. Marisol Quintanilla, an assistant professor of nematology at Michigan State University, was required to take a multiple choice D.E.I. test for continued employment, along with all faculty members; she was also asked to write a D.E.I. statement as part of her annual performance evaluations, which weigh heavily in the tenure process. Several designated answers in the test didn’t align with her religious or scientific beliefs, she said. The statement requirement was abandoned in March, but not without a protracted battle. “I’ve heard colleagues of mine saying they need to get rid of white men in academia,” Quintanilla, a Chilean immigrant of mixed ethnicity, told me. “It amounted to clear discrimination. I feel very uncomfortable with this because I think hiring the best qualified candidates would be best for the advancement of science.” Those are just three troubling practices detailed in the new paper. Sadly, they are part of a much larger set of developments. “What’s being advocated are philosophies that are explicitly anti-scientific,” Anna Krylov, a chemistry professor at the University of Southern California and one of the paper’s authors, told me. “They deny that objective truth exists.” Having grown up in the Soviet Union, where science was infused with Marxist-Leninist ideology, Krylov is particularly attuned to such threats. And while she has advocated on behalf of equal treatment for women in science, she prefers to be judged on the basis of her achievements, not on her sex. “The merit of scientific theories and findings do not depend on the identity of the scientist,” she said in a phone interview. It should go without saying — but in today’s polarized world, unfortunately, it doesn’t — that the authors of this paper do not deny the existence of historical racism or sexism or dispute that inequalities of opportunity persist. Nor do they deny that scientists have personal views, which are in turn informed by culture and society. They acknowledge biases and blind spots.  Where they depart from the prevailing ideological winds is in arguing that however imperfect, meritocracy is still the most effective way to ensure high quality science and greater equity. (A major study published last week shows that despite decades of sexism, claims of gender bias in academic science are now grossly overstated.) The focus, the authors write, should be on improving meritocratic systems rather than dismantling them. At a time when faith in institutions is plummeting and scientific challenges such as climate change remain enduringly large, the last thing we want is to give the public reason to lose faith in science. A study published last month, “Even When Ideologies Align, People Distrust Politicized Institutions,” shows that what we need is more impartiality, not less. If you believe bias is crucial to evaluating scientific work, you may object to the fact that several of the authors of the study are politically conservative, as are some of the researchers they cite. One author, Dorian Abbot, a geophysicist at the University of Chicago and a critic of some affirmative action and diversity programs, inspired outcry in 2021 when he was invited to speak at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But to deny the validity of this paper on that basis would mean succumbing to the very fallacies the authors so persuasively dismantle. One needn’t agree with every aspect of the authors’ politics or with all of their solutions. But to ignore or dismiss their research rather than impartially weigh the evidence would be a mistake. We need, in other words, to judge the paper on the merits. That, after all, is how science works.',

Would they come to different conclusions based on the same data because of their different backgrounds?</p><p>For most people, the suggestion isn’t just ludicrous; it’s offensive.</p><p>Yet this belief — that science is somehow subjective and should be practiced and judged accordingly — has recently taken hold in academic, governmental and medical settings. A paper published last week, “<a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/article/3/1/236">In Defense of Merit in Science</a>,” documents the disquieting ways in which research is <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://indefenseofmerit.org/">increasingly informed</a> by a politicized agenda, one that often characterizes science as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo7849">fundamentally</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-culture-of-white-privilege-discourages-black-students-from-becoming-physicists">racist</a> and in need of “<a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04123-3">decolonizing</a>.” The authors argue that science should instead be independent, evidence-based and focused on advancing knowledge.</p><p>This sounds entirely reasonable.</p><p>Yet the paper was rejected by several prominent mainstream journals, including The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Another publication that passed on the paper, the authors report, described some of its conclusions as “downright hurtful.” The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://indefenseofmerit.org/">took issue</a> with the word “merit” in the title, writing that “the problem is that this concept of merit, as the authors surely know, has been widely and legitimately attacked as hollow as currently implemented.”</p><p>Instead, the paper has been published in a new journal called — you can’t make this up — The Journal of Controversial Ideas. The journal, which welcomes papers that “discuss well-known controversial topics from diverse cultural, philosophical, moral, political and religious perspectives,” was co-founded in 2021 by the philosopher Peter Singer and is entirely serious. This particular paper was rewritten multiple times and peer-reviewed before publication. However controversial one judges the paper’s claims, they deserve consideration.</p></div><div><p>According to its 29 authors, who are primarily scientists (including two Nobel laureates) in fields as varied as theoretical physics, psychology and pharmacokinetics, ideological concerns are threatening independence and rigor in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine. Though the goal of expanding opportunity for more diverse researchers in the sciences is laudable, the authors write, it should not be pursued at the expense of foundational scientific concepts like objective truth, merit and evidence, which they claim are being jeopardized by efforts to account for differing perspectives.</p><p>Consider the increasingly widespread practice of appending a “positionality statement” to one’s research. This is an explicit <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1268044.pdf">acknowledgment</a> by the author of an academic paper of his or her identity (e.g., “nondisabled,” “continuing generation”). Positionality statements were first popular in the social sciences and are now spreading to the hard sciences and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9662153/">medicine</a>. The idea is that one’s race, sex, relative privilege and “experiences of oppression” inherently inform one’s research, especially in ways that perpetuate or alleviate bias.</p><p>But whatever validity “alternative ways of knowing,” “multiple narratives” and “<a title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/24/opinion/lived-experience-empathy-culture.html">lived experience</a>” may have in the humanities, they are of questionable utility when it comes to the sciences. Some defenders of positionality statements maintain that these acknowledgments promote objectivity by drawing attention to a researcher’s potential blind spots, but in practice they can&nbsp;have the opposite effect, implying that scientific research isn’t universally valid or applicable — that there are different kinds of knowledge for different groups of people.</p><p>Another concern is the rise of “<a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://lib.guides.umd.edu/ResearchEquity/CitationJustice">citation justice</a>” — the attempt to achieve racial or gender balance in scholarly references. The purpose of a citation in an academic publication is to substantiate claims and offer the most relevant supporting research. Advocates of citation justice say these citations too often prioritize the work of white men. But in a field like chemistry, in which fewer than 30 percent of papers are written by women, according to data from the American Chemical Society, and where the foundational texts are almost entirely written by men, “justice” means disproportionately favoring studies by women, regardless of relevance. Many prominent science journals now recommend that before submission, authors run their papers through software programs that detect any citation bias.</p><p>A third worrisome development is the statements that researchers are often required to write in order to apply for faculty jobs (and to advance in those positions) describing their commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, something my colleague John McWhorter, one of the paper’s authors, <a title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/19/opinion/heres-a-fact-were-routinely-asked-to-use-leftist-fictions.html">has written about</a> in The Times. These are noble goals that in practice, however, can amount to discrimination, and such statements strike many as a kind of political litmus test. At the University of California, Berkeley, for example, in the hiring cycle from 2018 to 2019, three-quarters of applicants for a set of five faculty positions in the life sciences were eliminated <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230326051550/https://ofew.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/life_sciences_inititatve.year_end_report_summary.pdf">on the basis of these statements</a> alone. (Grant programs also often require applications for funding in the sciences to include D.E.I. goals.)</p></div><div><p>Of course, nobody wants to hire a racist. But that’s not what we’re talking about. For a prospective faculty member to say he is determined to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://ofew.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/life_sciences_inititatve.year_end_report_summary.pdf">treat all students equally</a> rather than to advance diversity initiatives can be enough to count someone out of a job.</p><p>Marisol Quintanilla, an assistant professor of nematology at Michigan State University, was required to take a multiple choice D.E.I. test for continued employment, along with all faculty members; she was also asked to write a D.E.I. statement as part of her annual performance evaluations, which weigh heavily in the tenure process. Several designated answers in the test didn’t align with her religious or scientific beliefs, she said. The statement requirement was abandoned in March, but not without a protracted battle. “I’ve heard colleagues of mine saying they need to get rid of white men in academia,” Quintanilla, a Chilean immigrant of mixed ethnicity, told me. “It amounted to clear discrimination. I feel very uncomfortable with this because I think hiring the best qualified candidates would be best for the advancement of science.”</p><p>Those are just three troubling practices detailed in the new paper. Sadly, they are part of a much larger set of developments.</p><p>“What’s being advocated are philosophies that are explicitly anti-scientific,” Anna Krylov, a chemistry professor at the University of Southern California and one of the paper’s authors, told me. “They deny that objective truth exists.” Having grown&nbsp;up in the Soviet Union, where science was infused with Marxist-Leninist ideology, Krylov is particularly attuned to such threats. And while she has <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://iopenshell.usc.edu/wtc/index.html">advocated</a> on behalf of equal treatment for women in science, she prefers to be judged on the basis of her achievements, not on her sex. “The merit of scientific theories and findings do not depend on the identity of the scientist,” she said in a phone interview.</p><p>It should go without saying — but in today’s polarized world, unfortunately, it doesn’t — that the authors of this paper do not deny the existence of historical racism or sexism or dispute that inequalities of opportunity persist. Nor do they deny that scientists have personal views, which are in turn informed by culture and society. They acknowledge biases and blind spots.</p></div><div><p>Where they depart from the prevailing ideological winds is in arguing that however imperfect, meritocracy is still the most effective way to ensure high quality science and greater equity. (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/diversity-equity/2023/04/27/research-finds-no-gender-bias-academic-science?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&amp;utm_campaign=4b8b3c930f-DNU_2021_COPY_02&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-4b8b3c930f-236884614&amp;mc_cid=4b8b3c930f&amp;mc_eid=0804d4bb3e">A major study</a> published last week shows that despite decades of sexism, claims of gender bias in academic science are now grossly overstated.) The focus, the authors write, should be on improving meritocratic systems rather than dismantling them.</p><p>At a time when faith in institutions is plummeting and scientific challenges such as climate change remain enduringly large, the last thing we want is to give the public reason to lose faith in science. A <a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="" href="https://psyarxiv.com/sfubr/">study</a> published last month, “Even When Ideologies Align, People Distrust Politicized Institutions,” shows that what we need is <em>more</em> impartiality, not less.</p><p>If you believe bias is crucial to evaluating scientific work, you may object to the fact that several of the authors of the study are politically conservative, as are some of the researchers they cite. One author, Dorian Abbot, a geophysicist at the University of Chicago and a critic of some affirmative action and diversity programs, inspired <a title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/us/dorian-abbot-mit.html">outcry</a> in 2021 when he was invited to speak at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But to deny the validity of this paper on that basis would mean succumbing to the very fallacies the authors so persuasively dismantle.</p><p>One needn’t agree with every aspect of the authors’ politics or with all of their solutions. But to ignore or dismiss their research rather than impartially weigh the evidence would be a mistake. We need, in other words, to judge the paper on the merits. That, after all, is how science works.</p></div></section></article></div>'

					'The UK and US have intervened in the race to develop ever more powerful artificial intelligence technology, as the British competition watchdog launched a review of the sector and the White House advised tech firms of their fundamental responsibility to develop safe products.  Regulators are under mounting pressure to intervene, as the emergence of AI-powered language generators such as ChatGPT raises concerns about the potential spread of misinformation, a rise in fraud and the impact on the jobs market, with Elon Musk among nearly 30,000 signatories to a letter published last month urging a pause in significant projects.  The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Thursday it would look at the underlying systems – or foundation models – behind AI tools. The initial review, described by one legal expert as a “pre-warning” to the sector, will publish its findings in September.  On the same day, the US government announced measures to address the risks in AI development, as Kamala Harris, the vice-president, met chief executives at the forefront of the industry’s rapid advances. In a statement, the White House said firms developing the technology had a “fundamental responsibility to make sure their products are safe before they are deployed or made public”.  The meeting capped a week during which a succession of scientists and business leaders issued warnings about the speed at which the technology could disrupt established industries. On Monday, Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather of AI”, quit Google in order to speak more freely about the technology’s dangers, while the UK government’s outgoing scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, urged ministers to “get ahead” of the profound social and economic changes that could be triggered by AI, saying the impact on jobs could be as big as that of the Industrial Revolution.  Sarah Cardell said AI had the potential to “transform” the way businesses competed, but that consumers must be protected.  The CMA chief executive said: “AI has burst into the public consciousness over the past few months but has been on our radar for some time. It’s crucial that the potential benefits of this transformative technology are readily accessible to UK businesses and consumers while people remain protected from issues like false or misleading information.”  ChatGPT and Google’s rival Bard service are prone to delivering false information in response to users’ prompts, while concerns have been raised about AI-generated voice scams. The anti-misinformation outfit NewsGuard said this week that chatbots pretending to be journalists were running almost 50 AI-generated “content farms”. Last month, a song featuring fake AI-generated vocals purporting to be Drake and the Weeknd was pulled from streaming services.  The CMA review will look at how the markets for foundation models could evolve, what opportunities and risks there are for consumers and competition, and formulate “guiding principles” to support competition and protect consumers.  The leading players in AI are Microsoft, ChatGPT developer OpenAI – in which Microsoft is an investor – and Google parent Alphabet, which owns a world-leading AI business in UK-based DeepMind, while leading AI startups include Anthropic and Stability AI, the British company behind Stable Diffusion.  Alex Haffner, competition partner at the UK law firm Fladgate, said: “Given the direction of regulatory travel at the moment and the fact the CMA is deciding to dedicate resource to this area, its announcement must be seen as some form of pre-warning about aggressive development of AI programmes without due scrutiny being applied.”  In the US, Harris met the chief executives of OpenAI, Alphabet and Microsoft at the White House, and outlined measures to address the risks of unchecked AI development. In a statement following the meeting, Harris said she told the executives that “the private sector has an ethical, moral, and legal responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their products”.  The administration said it would invest $140m (£111m) in seven new national AI research institutes, to pursue artificial intelligence advances that are “ethical, trustworthy, responsible, and serve the public good”. AI development is dominated by the private sector, with the tech industry producing 32 significant machine-learning models last year, compared with three produced by academia.  Leading AI developers have also agreed to their systems being publicly evaluated at this year’s Defcon 31 cybersecurity conference. Companies that have agreed to participate include OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Stability AI.  “This independent exercise will provide critical information to researchers and the public about the impacts of these models,” said the White House.  Robert Weissman, the president of the consumer rights non-profit Public Citizen, praised the White House’s announcement as a “useful step” but said more aggressive action is needed. Weissman said this should including a moratorium on the deployment of new generative AI technologies, the term for tools such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion.  “At this point, Big Tech companies need to be saved from themselves. The companies and their top AI developers are well aware of the risks posed by generative AI. But they are in a competitive arms race and each believes themselves unable to slow down,” he said.  The EU was also told on Thursday that it must protect grassroots AI research or risk handing control of the technology’s development to US firms.  In an open letter coordinated by the German research group Laion – or Large-scale AI Open Network – the European parliament was told that one-size-fits-all rules risked eliminating open research and development.  “Rules that require a researcher or developer to monitor or control downstream use could make it impossible to release open-source AI in Europe,” which would “entrench large firms” and “hamper efforts to improve transparency, reduce competition, limit academic freedom, and drive investment in AI overseas”, the letter said.  “Europe cannot afford to lose AI sovereignty. Eliminating open-source R&D will leave the European scientific community and economy critically dependent on a handful of foreign and proprietary firms for essential AI infrastructure.”  The largest AI efforts, by companies such as OpenAI and Google, are heavily controlled by their creators. It is impossible to download the model behind ChatGPT, for instance, and the paid-for access that OpenAI provides to customers comes with a number of legal and technical restrictions on how it can be used. By contrast, open-source efforts involve creating a model and then releasing it for anyone to use, improve or adapt as they see fit.  “We are working on open-source AI because we think that sort of AI will be more safe, more accessible and more democratic,” said Christoph Schuhmann, the organisational lead at Laion.',

				content:
					'The prime minister of Belize, Johnny Briceño, has sharply criticised Rishi Sunak’s refusal to apologise for Britain’s role in the transatlantic slave trade, and said it was “quite likely” Belize would be the next member of the Commonwealth realm to become a republic.  Speaking in the country’s capital, Belmopan, Briceño argued that the British government had a moral responsibility to apologise for the atrocities of slavery, and added to calls throughout the English-speaking Caribbean for financial reparations from the UK.  “I think he [Sunak] has a moral responsibility to be able to offer at the very least an apology,” Briceño said. “He should have a better appreciation of it because of his ancestry.  “When you read and hear about the plundering that took place in the land of his ancestors, I do believe that he should have offered an apology.”  His comments came as a senior member of the Jamaican government said it would begin a process after the coronation to bring in an elected head of state.  Sunak, whose parents are of Punjabi Indian heritage, told parliament last week that he would not apologise for Britain’s role in slavery and colonialism. In response to a question from the Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, he said: “No. What I think our focus should now be on doing is, of course, understanding our history and all its parts, not running away from it, but right now making sure that we have a society which is inclusive and tolerant of people from all backgrounds.”  Briceño, who leads Belize’s centre-left People’s United party, took office in 2020, and in 2021 passed a parliamentary resolution committing the government to seek reparatory justice from the UK “on behalf of the former slaves and their descendants of Belize”.  Located in Central America, the former British colony is a member of the Caricom intergovernmental organisation of 20 Caribbean countries. The body has long advocated for reparative justice, and its reparations commission states that European governments connected to slavery and colonialism should follow a 10-point plan, which includes a public apology, commitments to education programmes, and cancellation of national debts.  Belize is one of 14 members of the Commonwealth realm, where the crown remains the symbolic head of state. It is the only country within the realm that King Charles III has never visited.  Last year, the Belizean government approved a bill to create a constitutional commission, which convened in November last year. The commission, which includes representation from many civil groups as well as Belize’s two main political parties, will consider a broad range of reform issues, including whether to become a republic.  There is bipartisan support for such a move, and Belize is now the only Caribbean country in the Commonwealth realm where the crown could be removed with a parliamentary vote rather than a referendum.  Jamaica’s minister for legal and constitutional affairs, Marlene Malahoo Forte, told Sky News that it could put the idea of replacing the British king as head of state with an elected presidency to a referendum as soon as 2024.  “While the United Kingdom is celebrating the coronation of the king, that is for the United Kingdom,” she said. “Jamaica is looking to write a new constitution … which will sever ties with the monarch as our head of state.”  Although Briceño has said he will put the commission’s broad recommendations to a referendum, he did not rule out removing the crown as head of state via parliament after the commission’s report. The recommendations are due next year.  Asked if he believed that Belize could be the next state to leave the Commonwealth realm after Barbados’s exit in 2021, Briceño replied: “I think the chance is quite high. It’s quite likely.”  He said he believed Belize would remain part of the Commonwealth of Nations, the political association of 56 states, mostly former territories of the British empire.  Belize will be represented at the king’s coronation by its governor general, Dame Froyla Tzalam.  Asked whether Belizeans were enthused by the event, Briceño said: “There is no excitement. We are so far away from the UK … You don’t see people taking out their union jack flags or anything.”',

					'Boris Johnson’s political future could be decided within weeks by a group of MPs investigating claims he misled parliament over Partygate, the Guardian has been told.  After holding off from doing anything that could be seen to influence the local elections or overshadowing King Charles’s coronation, the privileges committee is preparing to bring its inquiry into the former prime minister to a close.  Sources said that 23 and 24 May had been pencilled in to try to finalise a draft report that will rule on whether Johnson misled MPs about his knowledge of law-breaking parties in Downing Street during Covid.  The seven-member committee, which has a Conservative majority, will hold private meetings to sift through the evidence in an effort to come to a conclusion about Johnson’s conduct, according to insiders.  The hope is that the more than year-long inquiry can move to its last stage before the Commons goes into recess on 25 May.  However, the process is far from straightforward. It could take longer if MPs are split over whether Johnson misled parliament, and the sanction he would face as a result.  Once a draft report has been signed off by the privileges committee, Johnson will get two weeks to respond before the final report is published. Rishi Sunak’s government will then have to table a motion to endorse the findings.  But the issue could be dragged out further if Johnson or his allies try to fight any sanction by amending the motion – as happened when former MP Owen Paterson tried to escape being punished for lobbying.  Johnson has maintained his innocence. A spokesperson for the former PM said: “We continue to cooperate fully with the committee and will study its findings when they are brought forward. Mr Johnson did not knowingly, deliberately or wittingly mislead parliament.”  Some observers believe a recent precedent has been set for breaking Covid laws in the form of a ruling about former SNP MP Margaret Ferrier. She is appealing against a month-long suspension from the Commons – well above the threshold of 10 days that triggers a possible byelection.  While the punishment was imposed at the end of March by the standards committee, on which all the privileges committee MPs sit (bar Harriet Harman), there was a notable split.  Three Tories and one SNP MP tried to reduce the sanction to nine days, and were only defeated due to being outweighed by lay members. There are no lay members on the privileges committee, so it is unclear what the result might mean for Johnson.  Despite reams of evidence being collected – including WhatsApp messages, door logs and testimony by Johnson himself – being able to verify he deliberately misled MPs will be challenging.  An insider with knowledge of the process said it had been “very difficult to prove what he had in his head”.  There is no mechanism for MPs to appeal against findings by the privileges committee, so there may be a push for the system to be reformed if the committee finds against Johnson.  A House of Commons spokesperson said the committee’s makeup reflected the “political balance” of all MPs, and that each member had been appointed by the house. They added that the decision to carry out the inquiry was made by the Commons “as a whole” on 21 April last year, and that the committee remained “duty bound to proceed with the inquiry”.  Meanwhile, the Guardian has been told that taxpayer-funded legal support for Johnson will be extended for a third time.  After an initial budget of £129,000 was set aside for four months, covering August to December 2022, the total rose to £220,000 and the contract with law firm Peters & Peter was extended until February 2023.  As the inquiry dragged on, the contract was extended again until 30 April. While no update has been made to the government website, sources said the funding would be extended again.  The use of public money to cover Johnson’s Partygate defence has come under fire from Labour, and is being scrutinised by the National Audit Office, which acts as the government spending watchdog.',

					'The Metropolitan police has been accused of using the coronation to stage the biggest live facial recognition operation in British history.  The force said on Wednesday it intended to use the controversial technology, which scans faces and matches them against a list of people police want for alleged crimes and could identify convicted terrorists mingling in the crowds.  Hundreds of thousands of people are expected on the streets on Saturday as King Charles is crowned at Westminster Abbey, after a procession through central London, with a massive security operation in place.  The announcement came as police were given new powers to crack down on protest, enacted into law by government just days before the high-profile ceremonial event.  Campaigners fear the face-scanning technology could be used against protesters, and that police have done so before.  The Met insisted the technology would not be used to quell lawful protest or target activists. But campaign groups do not believe them. Britain’s biggest force said: “It is not used to identify people who are linked to, or have been convicted of, being involved in protest activity.”  A leading academic expert said the number of people whose faces would be scanned would make it the largest deployment yet of live facial recognition (LFR) in the UK.  The scale of the planned use of LFR was unprecedented, said Pete Fussey, who advises the biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner on human rights and ethnics and also led an independent review of the Met’s previous trials of LFR in 2018-19.  The largest previous LFR deployment was the 2017 Notting Hill carnival, when 100,000 faces were scanned.  Fussey said: “A surveillance deployment for the coronation would likely be the biggest live facial recognition operation ever conducted by the MPS, and probably the largest ever seen in Europe.  “Reviewing the statistics stated in their documents, the sum total of ‘recognition opportunities’ (individuals available for scanning) for the 10 operations between 2016 and 2019 was 180,000.  “101,000 of these occurred in a single event, the 2017 Notting Hill carnival. Facial recognition deployments since 2019 have been concentrated in Newham and the West End and, to my knowledge, have not focused on large mass attendance events.”  Police believe LFR is a potentially gamechanging crime-fighting tool, though its use by the state in the UK has so far been limited. Campaigners oppose its use.  Emmanuelle Andrews of the campaign group Liberty said: “The fact LFR is being used at the coronation is extremely worrying. LFR is a dystopian tool and dilutes all our rights and liberties.”  She said police had used it against protesters before, including against anti-arms trade campaigners and allegedly in 2022 on those opposing a bill giving police new powers.  Andrews said: “We have already seen a huge crackdown on protest ahead of the coronation, with new measures brought in this week to further restrict the ways in which people can make their voices heard.  “Now it’s likely that facial recognition will be used to monitor anyone who wants to exercise their right to protest – an extremely worrying development.”  The Met said at a media briefing that it intended to use LFR at the coronation, which is expected to attract huge crowds and hundreds of million of TV viewers around the world.  The Met deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said: “This is to pick up the people who are wanted for an offence or who have a warrant out against their name.”  A later Met statement added it would also look for “those under relevant offender management programmes in order to keep the public safe”, a probable reference to convicted terrorists, some of whom police and probation officers have visited in the run-up to the coronation, the Guardian understands, to check – for instance – that they are living where they claim to be.  The privacy group Big Brother Watch said: “Live facial recognition is an authoritarian mass surveillance tool that turns the public into walking ID cards.  “The coronation should not be used to justify the rollout of this discriminatory and dangerous technology. The hundreds of thousands of innocent people attending this historic event must not be subjected to biometric police identity checks as part of their celebrations.”  Using facial recognition, linked to databases of people police are interested in, is potentially the next big leap for law enforcement – as big as the introduction of fingerprinting – and police have been working on it for years. The security services are also hugely interested.  The Met is under pressure from government and certain Tory MPs to crack down on protest.  Adelekan said: “What we will not stand for … is anyone committing criminal acts in the name of protest. We will come down very swiftly.”  Asked whether police would consider someone on the route holding an anti-monarchy placard as meriting removal, Commander Karen Findlay, in charge of the police operation, said: “No.”  Asked if protest directly on the route is allowed, Adelekan said: “Protest is lawful,” adding that someone holding a placard did not count as serious disruption, as proscribed by law.  A later Met statement seemed to take a tougher approach: “Our tolerance for any disruption, whether through protest or otherwise, will be low. We will deal robustly with anyone intent on undermining this celebration.”  Police said they were continuing to investigate after a man threw shotgun cartridges at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening, after asking to speak to a soldier. He was arrested for alleged possession of a lock knife and possession of ammunition, and no injuries were reported.',

					'The former senior civil servant Sue Gray will take up her new role as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff even if the government’s appointments watchdog recommends a long delay to her start date, Labour has said.  Labour insiders believe the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) will suggest that Gray should wait for a significantly shorter period than the maximum two years it could recommend for senior officials taking up a job outside government.  There are also suggestions that Gray, who led the investigation into Partygate last year, could face restrictions on what she is allowed to do for Labour once in post rather than a delay.  It could mean she is in place to help on transition arrangements for government, which typically take place between senior Whitehall officials and opposition parties about six months before a general election.  Gray took the government by surprise with a plan to quit the civil service and become Starmer’s chief of staff this year, triggering an inquiry and an expectation that Acoba will place restrictions on when she can take up the role and what she can do.  It comes as a report said Gray’s first discussions with Starmer – a date neither Labour nor Gray has commented on – was in October last year, long after her inquiry into Boris Johnson and Covid rule-breaking parties was completed, but while the Commons privileges committee was gathering evidence on the same subject.  According to Sky News, Starmer initiated the contact, and she had “multiple” conversations afterwards with him and his team.  Starmer’s official spokesperson, asked on Wednesday whether Gray would be hired no matter how long her appointment is delayed, said: “Sue Gray is going to be Keir Starmer’s chief of staff.”  There is not now an interim chief of staff in place, with Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s campaign director, running the party’s operation before the next election.  However, Labour sources have indicated that they could hire an interim figure to conduct negotiations with Whitehall so the party is ready for power should it win the election, if Acoba does recommend a long delay. Starmer has said he will abide by the committee’s findings.  Labour is understood to be recruiting other current and former civil servants to key roles in the run-up to the next election. However, none of those are senior enough, and currently in post, to require them to go through the Acoba process.  It emerged on Tuesday that Gray chose not to cooperate with the internal government process looking into her move, which allies have suggested was politically motivated and legally questionable. On Wednesday Downing Street said that Rishi Sunak thought this was “obviously disappointing”.  However, Starmer’s spokesperson accused the Tories of trying to “politicise” the process by introducing an “additional political process [the Cabinet Office inquiry into the appointment] which is not part of the standard process” just before the local elections.  “The Labour party is fully supporting the Acoba process, and the Acoba process is that Sue Gray submits her form with the information as requested of her by Acoba in the usual way,” the spokesperson said.  He also said it was “bizarre that the government is choosing to spend its time discussing a former civil servant 48 hours before polling day rather than the issues that actually matter to voters”.  It is understood that Gray is being represented in her discussions with the Cabinet Office by the FDA, the union for senior civil servants, with no direct Labour involvement.  The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, described the internal inquiry as a “political gimmick” to pursue a “vendetta” against Gray.  However, Sunak’s spokesperson denied that the internal inquiry – which ministers failed to publish on Tuesday despite widespread briefings that it had found that Gray had broken the code – was motivated by revenge.  Asked whether Gray did advise the Cabinet Office on the privileges committee investigation into Boris Johnson, as has been claimed in some reports, the press secretary replied: “Not that I’m aware of.”  She also declined to comment on reports that the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, banned ministers from putting out a fuller statement on Gray’s job move, after insiders said he “overreached” by initially allowing plans for the publication of the findings to go ahead.  There is expected to be a further update from the Cabinet Office on the internal inquiry into Gray’s departure, although it is unclear whether this would take place before Acoba makes its recommendation.  On Wednesday night the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, suggested Starmer was acting “shifty” over questions about when he first approached Gray to be his chief-of-staff.  He told ITV’s Peston programme: “All Keir Starmer needs to do is cooperate, to say what the contacts were that he initiated. And I think it is unchivalrous and wrong of Keir Starmer not to fess up.  “He should be straight, he shouldn’t be sort of ‘taking the Fifth’ and avoiding the question,” he added, referring to the US constitutional right against self-incrimination at trial.  “It only reinforces the impression that people have that he is shifty and that he can’t be straight with us.”',

					"Police announced the latest arrest around 08:40 local time (07:40 BST) on Friday. The suspect - who has only been identified by his initials UB - was detained near the city of Kragujevac, the interior ministry said.  The arrest followed an extensive manhunt, which local media reported involved over 600 police officers. Early on Friday morning, Serbian media said that special police forces had arrived at the villages of Mladenovac and Dubona, where the latest shooting occurred.  Reports on local media say the suspect - who the interior ministry said was born in 2002 - started firing at people with an automatic weapon after having an argument with a police officer in a park in Dubona on Thursday evening.  The man is then said to have proceeded to shoot people from a car, killing at least eight people and wounding many more.  Speaking at a news conference after the attack on Friday, Serbia's president called the shooting an attack on us all and announced a host of new security measures, including a plan to hire 1,200 new police officers.  Aleksander Vucic also announced a ban on new gun permits, tougher penalties for illegal weapons possession and phycological checks of gun owners. He said the new laws would result in the practical disarmament of Serbia.  The western Balkans are awash with illegal weapons following wars and unrest in the 1990s. In 2019, it was estimated that there are 39.1 firearms per 100 people in Serbia - the third highest in the world, behind the US and Montenegro.

					"Last updated on .From the section European Football  Napoli won their first Serie A title for 33 years as they drew with Udinese at Dacia Arena to spark jubilant celebrations back in Naples.  Victor Osimhen smashed in a 52nd-minute equaliser after Sandi Lovric had given Udinese a shock lead.  And Napoli held on to the point they needed to win their third Serie A title with five games to spare.  Seeing Neapolitans happy is enough to give you a sense of that joy they are feeling, Napoli boss Luciano Spalletti told DAZN.  These people will look to this moment when life gets hard, they have every right to celebrate like this.  You feel a bit more relaxed knowing that you've given them this moment of happiness. • None 'Football is everything' - what Scudetto means to Naples  Napoli's previous two titles came in the days of Argentina legend Maradona - who their stadium is now named after - in 1987 and 1990.  Following those glory days the club fell into financial decline, relegation and bankruptcy; playing in Serie C as recently as 2006.  They have won the Coppa Italia three times in the past 11 seasons but it is the Scudetto the Napoli fans craved.  They now have a new cast of superstars, with Nigeria forward Victor Osimhen scoring 21 goals in 26 league games and Georgia winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia contributing 12 goals and 10 assists.  At 64 boss Luciano Spalletti, who twice won the Coppa Italia with Roma, becomes the oldest manager to win Serie A.  His team had the chance to lift the title with six games to spare last weekend but could only draw with local rivals Salernitana.  But with a 16-point advantage over second-placed Lazio their third Serie A title is now confirmed.  Their match with Udinese was almost an afterthought. Napoli fans had been partying in Naples all day before filling the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona to watch a stream of the match.  Over 10,000 fans travelled north to see their side in Udine but they were stunned into silence after 13 minutes when Lovric was given acres of space in the box before curling the hosts in front.  Napoli struggled in the first half but got the goal they needed after the restart with Osimhen finding the corner after Kvaratskhelia had forced a good save from Udinese keeper Marco Silvestri.  And after taking the lead Napoli managed the game superbly, keeping their opponents at arm's length.  On the full-time whistle Napoli fans raced onto the pitch, starting celebrations in both Udine and Naples.  It is an amazing feeling, we have waited so many years for this moment, Osimhen told DAZN.  To be able to deliver the Scudetto to the Neapolitans is something that we will never forget in a hurry and will continue to live in our hearts for the rest of our lives.",

					"By now, most of you will have seen the dramatic images that came out of Russia this week.  Even Russian state TV appeared to cast doubt on that version on Wednesday evening. One analyst on Channel 1's Vremya evening news bulletin observed: The kind of explosive charge carried by drones like these cannot do widespread damage. This attack was clearly just for show.  We don't attack Putin or Moscow, said President Volodymr Zelensky this week. We fight on our territory. We're defending our villages and cities. We don't have enough weapons for this.  But suppose this was, indeed, an operation conceived and carried out by Ukraine, or by a group in Russia sympathetic to Kyiv? Even if this was just for show?  That would be hugely embarrassing for the Kremlin. Just imagine: the seat of Russian power, one of the most heavily guarded complexes in the world, penetrated by a couple of drones packed with explosives - despite all the air defence systems protecting Moscow and the jamming systems the Kremlin surely has to keep dangerous drones at a distance and to prevent such attacks.  It was telling how the main evening news bulletins on Russian TV channels reported this week's incident. It was the top story. But neither of the bulletins I watched, Vremya on Channel 1 and Vesti on Russia-1, broadcast those dramatics videos of explosions and smoke.  Instead, they used library footage of the Kremlin and Red Square. Perhaps because the image of a defenceless Kremlin under attack was too uncomfortable to share. Russian newspapers covered the story the following day, however, not in great detail.  And yet, ever since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it has shown it is ready to escalate the conflict without a need for any pretext. Why would it stage-manage such a potentially embarrassing incident that many will interpret as a sign of the Kremlin's weakness? And think back to those TV news bulletins: they avoided showing images of the explosions.  There are other theories. Could what happened be the result of infighting in the corridors of power here, between different groups vying for influence over the Kremlin?",

Much remains unclear about what happened but here are my thoughts:</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The official version of events - the Kremlin version - is that this was a Ukrainian drone attack (two drones, in fact) targeting President Vladimir Putin himself.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>An <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65471904">attempt to assassinate the Russian president</a>? Seems unlikely. President Putin does have a private apartment in the Kremlin but his main residence is 32km (20 miles) away.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Even Russian state TV appeared to cast doubt on that version on Wednesday evening. One analyst on Channel 1\'s Vremya evening news bulletin observed: "The kind of explosive charge carried by drones like these cannot do widespread damage. This attack was clearly just for show."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"We don\'t attack Putin or Moscow," said President Volodymr Zelensky this week. "We fight on our territory. We\'re defending our villages and cities. We don\'t have enough weapons for this."</p></div><div data-component="video-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>WATCH: Russian video circulates after Kremlin attack claims</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But suppose this was, indeed, an operation conceived and carried out by Ukraine, or by a group in Russia sympathetic to Kyiv? Even if this was "just for show"?</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>That would be hugely embarrassing for the Kremlin. Just imagine: the seat of Russian power, one of the most heavily guarded complexes in the world, penetrated by a couple of drones packed with explosives - despite all the air defence systems protecting Moscow and the jamming systems the Kremlin surely has to keep dangerous drones at a distance and to prevent such attacks.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Improbable, impossible even? Well, think back to 1987 when West German teenager Mathias Rust evaded Soviet air defences and landed his Cessna plane on Red Square. History shows that nothing is impossible.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It was telling how the main evening news bulletins on Russian TV channels reported this week\'s incident. It was the top story. But neither of the bulletins I watched, Vremya on Channel 1 and Vesti on Russia-1, broadcast those dramatics videos of explosions and smoke. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Instead, they used library footage of the Kremlin and Red Square. Perhaps because the image of a defenceless Kremlin under attack was too uncomfortable to share. Russian newspapers covered the story the following day, however, not in great detail.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But back to rumours and speculation. Social media is awash with cries of "fake!" and "false flag!" </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Some commentators suspect it was staged by the Russian authorities or by elements of the security services to provide a pretext for escalating the war in Ukraine. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And yet, ever since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it has shown it is ready to escalate the conflict without a need for any pretext. Why would it stage-manage such a potentially embarrassing incident that many will interpret as a sign of the Kremlin\'s weakness? And think back to those TV news bulletins: they avoided showing images of the explosions. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There are other theories. Could what happened be the result of infighting in the corridors of power here, between different groups vying for influence over the Kremlin?</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As I said in my disclaimer, I do not have the definitive answer. Just lots of questions. </p></div><div data-component="video-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Watch: An inside look at life in Russia 14 months after invasion of Ukraine</p></figcaption></figure></div><section data-component="links-block"><p></p><h2>More on this story</h2><p></p></section></article></main></div></div>'

					"Adidas has said the ending of its collaboration with Kanye West is hurting the business, with sales in North America hard hit.  The sportswear giant cut its ties with the designer and rapper, known as Ye, late last year after he posted anti-Semitic comments on social media.  West designed trainers under the Yeezy brand and Adidas said the loss of the business cut sales by €400m (£350m) in the first quarter of the year.  Despite the dip, the figures were better than analysts had been expecting and Adidas said that sales were up 9% when the impact of the Yeezy business was excluded.  Adidas said it was benefiting from the current trend for terrace style trainers and was seeing extraordinary demand for its Samba, Gazelle and Campus brands.  Terrace styles are those that were originally popular among football fans in the 1980s, when supporters first embraced designer fashion brands such as Fila and Sergio Tacchini.  While Adidas said it had a limited supply of such shoes at the start of the year, it plans to increase production in the coming months.  In its latest results, Adidas said sales in North America had fallen by 20% as the region was particularly affected by the ending of the Yeezy business.  The company scrapped its tie-up with West in October last year following the rapper's anti-Semitic comments. At the time, the firm said: Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech.  Adidas said that if it decided not to repurpose its remaining unsold Yeezy stock, this would hit its operating profit by €500m this year.  In response, Adidas said it rejected these unfounded claims, adding that it would take all necessary measures to vigorously defend ourselves against them.",

Prigozhin is a publicity seeker, and his influence has seemingly waned in recent months.

Only last week he told a Russian pro-war blogger that Wagner fighters in Bakhmut were down to their last days of supplies of bullets, and needed thousands of rounds of ammunition.  If shortages were not tackled then his mercenaries would be forced either to retreat or remain and die, he warned: Then, no matter what our bureaucrats want, everything else will crumble.  The battle for Bakhmut has dragged for months and is thought to have claimed thousands of lives. Wagner troops and regular Russian forces have fought on the same side, against the Ukrainian military.  In his new announcement, standing in front of his men, he said on 10 May they would be obliged to transfer positions in the settlement of Bakhmut to units of the defence ministry and withdraw the remains of Wagner to logistics camps to lick our wounds.  Prigozhin has himself predicted that Ukraine's counter-offensive will begin by 15 May, as tanks and artillery will be able to advance in dry weather, after the last spring rain.  Prigozhin said earlier he had offered him the post of deputy to a Wagner commander, pointing out that the general had done his best to help supply mercenaries with ammunition and had co-operated with the group's efforts to recruit convicted prisoners to its ranks.",

					"A glistening, glamorous sparkling celebrity wedding-esque-themed night. A who’s who of Hollywood in a fairytale amalgamation of glitz. Let’s raise a toast to the 2023 Met Gala and begin by taking a trip down memory lane…  Religion, Camp, American a vast array of glorious themes for us fashion writers to get our teeth into.  Firstly, what is the Met Gala? Well, dear reader, this highly anticipated- probably the biggest event in the fashion calendar — is merely a fundraising abut on the grandest scale. It was curated to raise money for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Insitute.  The night is mainly organised by Vouge’s editor-in-chief Miss Anna Wintour and brings together THE celebrities of the moment in one star-studded spectacle. It is known to most fashion lovers, such as myself, as the most important night of the year.  Now I’m going to rewind back to my two favourite Met Galas to prepare you for this year’s analysis.  Nothing, I repeat nothing has ever topped this Met Gala for me. The theme was bewitching and decadent, and the looks are so ingrained within my psyche that I’ll never fully be over it. The key was Miss Kim K herself, who on that evening in question became the Queen of the Met. Kim’s golden perfectly fitted Versace dress and face that was contoured to the gods were of gargantuan cultural significance.  The year was 2018, peak Kardashian time. Kim- Ye were the couple, likes were our currency and the Kardashian-esque street/fitness wear was our obsession. Her look encompassed all this, in a vision of sculpted perfection, this was beauty in the 2010s. And that my friends is the importance of the Gala, it takes the culture and merges it into the world of costume and theatre; its significance is something that should never be underestimated.  In 2019 we moved away from religious crucifixes to the stupendously fun and frolicky world of Camp. My main memory was simply an array of pink mist. It felt light, whimsical and the key players- Lady Gaga and Harry Styles.  Harry wore the most iconic male Met Gala look of all time. The sheer, the simplicity, the earrings, the look ahead of 2019.  Again, the image rests deep within my psyche, as there is something just so gorgeous that it omits. I’m going to use a term here that I’ll come back to a few times in this piece and that is pronounced chic. Now, by this term, I mean strong, vivid, bold but subtle and not overstated. Harry’s look perfectly encompassed these elements, making it so striking it feels like that of a painting.  Gaga. Gaga did what Gaga does best- camp. She didn’t just bring a look, she brought a performance which is a must-watch for any Met-Gala lover.  In it, she plays the part of, let’s just say, Mrs Camp. The lightness, the flicks, the constant look of surprise. The men around her then begin to unveil her, alongside her dear friend and designer Brandon Maxwell. In this fifteen minutes of pure campery, Gaga does not break character once. A small carriage then appears, and everything starts to come off- to which you hear paparazzi say ‘There’s a reveal!’. Then more shock from Gaga, as we see the classic black dress delivered with an umbrella. Can we also take a moment to appreciate the over-exaggerated golden eyelashes- the drama. We then move to the third, what we think is the final layer — A PINK DRESS. More Shock, and Monroe- esk moves to accompany. Next, a telephone touching on her own Gaga-verse, referencing / not referencing…  We then get a whole ensemble performance of Camp and Gaga putting on makeup with the Paparrazi. And the final layer, simply black underwear — the full feminine physique. Altogether, silly, entertaining and perfectly fitting to the theme. Again, perfectly pronounced chic, but with the extra layers of exaggeration, commitment and theatre. All of these elements are what it takes to win the Met Gala.  Now read on, to see who achieve Gaga levels this year…  The theme this year was well… controversial. However, this is a fashion review. I’m not here to get political, I’m here to analyse so here’s my take on the theme.  The theme will be focusing mainly on Karl’s work for Chanel and Fendi. Meaning you need to be going classic and pure, think pearls and tweed. Then within this, there should be elements of how Lagerfeld took the fashion of old and re-invented it to make it contemporary. Take for example a classic Chanel suit but heightening the cut and using more modern colours such as pink and purple- see below.  He loved strong cuts, extreme shoulders and classic colours such as black and white, and not forgetting touches of the gothic. With the incorporation of Chanel, expect many a Chanel Bride, a quintessential statement piece for this brand.  Now Cats. Lagerfeld’s Cat Choupette, was his pride and joy and still to this day lives an exceptionally lavish lifestyle. The incorporation of feline energy will be paramount to this particular Gala. The question is by who?  What I personally would have worn  Cringe, but I don’t care because I love my idea.  So, if I were to have attended (in an alternate universe!) I would have fully gone with the Cat theme but then mixed it with the touches of Karl. All black, with a hood of a Cat going over my head and then a regal body that drapes for miles across the carpet.  Then the signature Chanel tweed weaved in and also a long cat string toy to give it some pizzazz. I’d want my makeup to have subtle hints of white on my eyelashes, and possibly even white lipstick depending on if it worked or not. Giving a black and white glamour cat with all the Lagerfeld touches needed to fully unify this theme.  For my main bulk of Met Gala analysis, I come to you from a coffee shop. I am prepped with my notebook, Chia Iced Tea and ready to give you a humongous deep-dive into the biggest night in fashion.  This was the first Met Gala without the backdrop of Covid, so the air last night (even in my London bedroom) was filled with exhilaration and anticipation. I had the Vouge coverage showing on my TV, and the most recent pap pics refreshing on my laptop, I was ready.  So here are my first notes.  The first element I noticed was the carpet, it wasn’t what I was expecting. I was thinking it was going to be full white but instead, it had a couple of coordinating colours giving vibrancy  White everywhere, a bridal-like theme, thick fabrics, Chloe Finneman’s cat handbag. Lots of little touches such as Nicole Kidman’s bow, and nice nods to Largefeld- very clever. A classical Fairytale vibe in the air. The first few looks were a nice welcome back but I wasn’t wowed yet…  As the night swirled on I really started to get excited.  I jotted down words such as romantic, historic, regal and chic. Mostly, pure Chanel and the feeling that this Met Gala is a giant fairytale celebrity wedding. The footage is vibrant and buzzy, and the are looks and coming in thick and fast.  Now for my winners…  Doja did the cat, and my oh my what a perfect way to bring herself as an artist being a CAT and Karl’s beloved Cat together, with an almost spookily prosthetic face. The bejewelled silver Oscar De Le Renta Gown was distinct but not in your face, the cat face on the other hand you couldn’t miss. How she managed to still look so stunning with the face of a Cat is beyond me. A moment, thank you Doja.  One of this year’s co-chairs and she brought us Hollywood.  What is a co-chair? The Co-Chairs help to create the atmosphere. They select some of the interiors, put together the guest lists and also act as greeters within the event.  Penelope came dressed in a beautiful Chanel sheer gown from Couture Spring / Summer Collection 1988. It gave off a bridal yet regal essence to the nth degree.  My favourite poser of the night, she was confident and self-assured, present and oozed effortless sophistication. One of my most loved looks, more for just her as a person; bringing that old-school 90s Hollywood we so desperately and nostalgically cling to. I adore the dress too, fair and alluring, detailed and was a perfect nod to the classic Chanel Bride.  Not one of my favourite Kim looks, she went with an elegant Schiaparelli bodycon and referenced her pearl look from one of her first photoshoots ‘you’re doing great sweetie’, by covering her body in 50,000 worth of pearls.  The press is saying it's an accident that she referenced the old Kardashian episode. However, this is what you have to understand about the Kardashians- nothing is an accident. Kim knew exactly what she was doing, she was aware that wearing pearls would bring the video back into circulation keeping the Kardashian name at the top of the trending sphere. Job well done.  I like this touch as I adore it when celebrities reference their past. It’s clever, bringing in the easter eggs to create a feeling of mystery and elation.  Kardashian, this year, has moved away from the shock factor. In 2021 she went faceless, and then in 2022, the Monroe dress caused a huge backlash. In 2023, Kim has taken more of a backseat with a subtler approach. Still a lovely look, but I hope next year we go back to something a bit more risque…  I wasn’t too sure how this was a reference to Karl, but I adored the pure drama of it. Nas turned up sprayed head to toe in silver, donning a matching thong and not forgetting the Swarovski crystals. Altogether bamboozling and bedazzling; he created astonishment and humour, and I loved the skipping up and down the carpet. I’m a fan.  A celebrity like Lil Nas X is destined for Met Gala greatness, he has the silliness and courageousness to go far. His last few looks have served, and with this kind of portfolio, I expect his next Gala to be more elevated and go to the next level.  A sentimental moment. Nicole sported her iconic 2004 Chanel No. 5 dress. Ultimate Chanel, and a perfect gesture to Karl. The actress looked incredible, of course. My one note would be that I needed more from the hair. She had it down, and it was understatedly chic, BUT for this Met Gala which is an all-encompassing celebration of Chanel, just down isn’t enough. Chanel is all about sophistication and Cosmopolitan, her idea here was to contrast. Yet, Karl wasn’t about messiness, think more about rigidity. The hair needed something extra, although I did enjoy the bow.  As a side note, let’s discuss the 2004 Chanel advert. This era was a truly marvellous time for the Perfume ad, Chanel being the crowning jewel. You see Nicole run through the streets of New York, with her stunning dress flowing onto Time Square street and her lover staring out of a shining C, then Nicole is seen performing the classic starlet turn on the red carpet solidifying her as THE movie star of the 2000s. I’m gushing at this point, but my oh my do I love this advert.  Scratching my ‘Funny Met Gala Look’ itch, our second Choupette, and pure feline. I loved it, this will be an image that sticks when I think of this Met Gala, altogether fun, taking the theme and pushing it to the complete max.  Leto wanted to fully commit to being a cat, and the designers came through. One of the biggest shocks of the night, this costume was kept top secret. He didn’t want anyone to know that the Cat was him until the last minute, which he brilliantly achieved. Jared brought the mystery and astonishment that we oh so crave.  The Princess of Geornovia gave that Versace sensuality and perfectly pronounced chic, fitting the brief while bringing those gorgeous cuts that only my favourite brand can pull off. A hot favourite of the night; a demure, dramatic and momentous Versace look. Also, can we mention the Brigitte Bardot hair, giving a European goddess mystique- magnificent.  Andrea must have taken all that Miranda Priestly wisdom, as Hathaway has made a fashion comeback in the past couple of years. Her recent serves are carefully curated, bang on the trends and effervescently unique, probably the reason Versace picked her as their new IT girl. Did I mention they’re my favourite…  Come through Gucci- my favourite look of the night! Bringing The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.  The Gucci girl. Glamorous, Powerful, Feminine, Blonde and Hollywood. Just everything. Giving the theme of Karl Lagerfeld with his mysterious and intimidating demeanour, and putting it into the female form- genius.  Crystal clear and fitting of the theme. THE fashion girl, touching on the likes of Donatella Versace- the glasses! Jessica, like Gaga, committed to her role. Another must if you’re going to be a winner in the Met Gala, really and I mean REALLY play the part. Jessica, being the talented actress that she is, was devoted and masterful in bringing this 15-minute part to life.  Another key component in order to win at the Met is to debut something brand new. We’re used to this actress with her vibrant red locks, and here she introduced us to Blonde Jessica- a lady not to be messed with!  The trends present at this Gala include Icy White, Gothic Chic, Historic References and the Modern-Day Fairytale. I predict a romantic shift in fashion, with more classical feminine pieces making their way into the summer zeitgeist and classical gothic black/ whites, looping back to our Winter trends. I’m thinking much white, block colours, and dresses. Think snowy to contrast the hotter months.  I’m also envisioning the return of the 2017 icy white hair, or what is becoming known as Barbie Blonde, moving away from balayage. Think vivid.  A lovely well-rounded Met Gala, however not topping 2018/19 for me- but hey maybe that’s just my nostalgia.  The looks were striking, romantic and bold. We’re back to the full Gala glory and it’s tremendously exciting. I thoroughly enjoyed, and wow there were some stand-outs. Although, in my opinion, the celebs could have been even more risque, I wanted more memes and drama. Yet the stage has been set, mark my words next year the looks will be elevated further and maybe even back to the heights of 2018.",

A who’s who of Hollywood in a fairytale amalgamation of glitz. Let’s raise a toast to the 2023 Met Gala and begin by taking a trip down memory lane…</h2><h2 id="3991">A Rewind</h2><p id="556b"><em>Religion, Camp, American a vast array of glorious themes for us fashion writers to get our teeth into.</em></p><p id="2c0f">Firstly, what is the Met Gala? Well, dear reader, this highly anticipated- probably the biggest event in the fashion calendar — is merely a fundraising abut on the grandest scale. It was curated to raise money for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Insitute.</p><p id="ae75">The night is mainly organised by Vouge’s editor-in-chief Miss Anna Wintour and brings together THE celebrities of the moment in one star-studded spectacle. It is known to most fashion lovers, such as myself, as the most important night of the year.</p><p id="8ff1">Now I’m going to rewind back to my two favourite Met Galas to prepare you for this year’s analysis.</p><p id="4714"><strong>2018 Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination</strong></p><p id="def2">Nothing, I repeat nothing has ever topped this Met Gala for me. The theme was bewitching and decadent, and the looks are so ingrained within my psyche that I’ll never fully be over it. The key was Miss Kim K herself, who on that evening in question became the Queen of the Met. Kim’s golden perfectly fitted Versace dress and face that was contoured to the gods were of gargantuan cultural significance.</p><p id="7b88">The year was 2018, peak Kardashian time. Kim- Ye were the couple, likes were our currency and the Kardashian-esque street/fitness wear was our obsession. Her look encompassed all this, in a vision of sculpted perfection, this was beauty in the 2010s. And that my friends is the importance of the Gala, it takes the culture and merges it into the world of costume and theatre; its significance is something that should never be underestimated.</p><p id="a60b"><strong>2019 — Camp — Notes on Fashion</strong></p><p id="560a">In 2019 we moved away from religious crucifixes to the stupendously fun and frolicky world of Camp. My main memory was simply an array of pink mist. It felt light, whimsical and the key players- Lady Gaga and Harry Styles.</p><p id="45c5">Harry wore the most iconic male Met Gala look of all time. The sheer, the simplicity, the earrings, the look ahead of 2019.</p><p id="acc8">Again, the image rests deep within my psyche, as there is something just so gorgeous that it omits. I’m going to use a term here that I’ll come back to a few times in this piece and that is <em>pronounced chic. </em>Now, by this term, I mean strong, vivid, bold but subtle and not overstated. Harry’s look perfectly encompassed these elements, making it so striking it feels like that of a painting.</p><p id="3ee3">Gaga. Gaga did what Gaga does best- camp. She didn’t just bring a look, she brought a performance which is a must-watch for any Met-Gala lover.</p><figure></figure><p id="0ebc">In it, she plays the part of, let’s just say, Mrs Camp. The lightness, the flicks, the constant look of surprise. The men around her then begin to unveil her, alongside her dear friend and designer Brandon Maxwell. In this fifteen minutes of pure campery, Gaga does not break character once. A small carriage then appears, and everything starts to come off- to which you hear paparazzi say ‘There’s a reveal!’. Then more shock from Gaga, as we see the classic black dress delivered with an umbrella. Can we also take a moment to appreciate the over-exaggerated golden eyelashes- the drama. We then move to the third, what we think is the final layer — A PINK DRESS. More Shock, and Monroe- esk moves to accompany. Next, a telephone touching on her own Gaga-verse, <em>referencing / not referencing…</em></p><p id="75f9">We then get a whole ensemble performance of Camp and Gaga putting on makeup with the Paparrazi. And the final layer, simply black underwear — the full feminine physique. Altogether, silly, entertaining and perfectly fitting to the theme. Again, perfectly pronounced chic, but with the extra layers of exaggeration, commitment and theatre. All of these elements are what it takes to win the Met Gala.</p><p id="f264">Now read on, to see who achieve Gaga levels this year…</p><h2 id="a963">The Theme</h2><p id="5d4d">The theme this year was well… controversial. However, this is a fashion review. I’m not here to get political, I’m here to analyse so here’s my take on the theme.</p><p id="36f6"><strong>Karl Lagerfeld: A Line in Beauty</strong></p><p id="41f0">The theme will be focusing mainly on Karl’s work for Chanel and Fendi. Meaning you need to be going classic and pure, think pearls and tweed. Then within this, there should be elements of how Lagerfeld took the fashion of old and re-invented it to make it contemporary. Take for example a classic Chanel suit but heightening the cut and using more modern colours such as pink and purple- see below.</p><p id="12cb">He loved strong cuts, extreme shoulders and classic colours such as black and white, and not forgetting touches of the gothic. With the incorporation of Chanel, expect many a Chanel Bride, a quintessential statement piece for this brand.</p><p id="eb45">Now Cats. Lagerfeld’s Cat Choupette, was his pride and joy and still to this day lives an exceptionally lavish lifestyle. The incorporation of feline energy will be paramount to this particular Gala. The question is by who?</p><p id="bca1"><strong>What I personally would have worn</strong></p><p id="b256"><em>Cringe, but I don’t care because I love my idea.</em></p><p id="e2c3">So, if I were to have attended (in an alternate universe!) I would have fully gone with the Cat theme but then mixed it with the touches of Karl. All black, with a hood of a Cat going over my head and then a regal body that drapes for miles across the carpet.</p><p id="9c7d">Then the signature Chanel tweed weaved in and also a long cat string toy to give it some pizzazz. I’d want my makeup to have subtle hints of white on my eyelashes, and possibly even white lipstick depending on if it worked or not. Giving a black and white glamour cat with all the Lagerfeld touches needed to fully unify this theme.</p><h2 id="aac2"><strong>The Build-Up</strong></h2><figure></figure><p id="14bb"><em>For my main bulk of Met Gala analysis, I come to you from a coffee shop. I am prepped with my notebook, Chia Iced Tea and ready to give you a humongous deep-dive into the biggest night in fashion.</em></p><p id="df49">This was the first Met Gala without the backdrop of Covid, so the air last night (even in my London bedroom) was filled with exhilaration and anticipation. I had the Vouge coverage showing on my TV, and the most recent pap pics refreshing on my laptop, I was ready.</p><h2 id="730c">First Reaction</h2><p id="7b36"><em>So here are my first notes.</em></p><p id="44de">The first element I noticed was the carpet, it wasn’t what I was expecting. I was thinking it was going to be full white but instead, it had a couple of coordinating colours giving vibrancy</p><p id="9b0f">White everywhere, a bridal-like theme, thick fabrics, Chloe Finneman’s cat handbag. Lots of little touches such as Nicole Kidman’s bow, and nice nods to Largefeld- very clever. A classical Fairytale vibe in the air. The first few looks were a nice welcome back but I wasn’t wowed yet…</p><h2 id="aafb">Second Reaction</h2><p id="e13c"><em>As the night swirled on I really started to get excited.</em></p><p id="89ff">I jotted down words such as romantic, historic, regal and chic. Mostly, pure Chanel and the feeling that this Met Gala is a giant fairytale celebrity wedding. The footage is vibrant and buzzy, and the are looks and coming in thick and fast.</p><p id="3461">Now for my winners…</p><h2 id="df03">The Winners</h2><p id="3a18"><strong>Doja Cat</strong></p><p id="e657">Doja did the cat, and my oh my what a perfect way to bring herself as an artist being a CAT and Karl’s beloved Cat together, with an almost spookily prosthetic face. The bejewelled silver Oscar De Le Renta Gown was distinct but not in your face, the cat face on the other hand you couldn’t miss. How she managed to still look so stunning with the face of a Cat is beyond me. A moment, thank you Doja.</p><p id="a58a"><strong>Penelope Cruz</strong></p><p id="c996">One of this year’s co-chairs and she brought us Hollywood.</p><p id="f13c"><em>What is a co-chair? The Co-Chairs help to create the atmosphere. They select some of the interiors, put together the guest lists and also act as greeters within the event.</em></p><p id="9c52">Penelope came dressed in a beautiful Chanel sheer gown from Couture Spring / Summer Collection 1988. It gave off a bridal yet regal essence to the nth degree.</p><p id="1904">My favourite poser of the night, she was confident and self-assured, present and oozed effortless sophistication. One of my most loved looks, more for just her as a person; bringing that old-school 90s Hollywood we so desperately and nostalgically cling to. I adore the dress too, fair and alluring, detailed and was a perfect nod to the classic Chanel Bride.</p><p id="cde5"><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></p><p id="2e38">Not one of my favourite Kim looks, she went with an elegant Schiaparelli bodycon and referenced her pearl look from one of her first photoshoots <em>‘you’re doing great sweetie’</em>, by covering her body in 50,000 worth of pearls.</p><p id="eae1">The press is saying it\'s an accident that she referenced the old Kardashian episode. However, this is what you have to understand about the Kardashians- nothing is an accident. Kim knew exactly what she was doing, she was aware that wearing pearls would bring the video back into circulation keeping the Kardashian name at the top of the trending sphere. Job well done.</p><p id="947a">I like this touch as I adore it when celebrities reference their past. It’s clever, bringing in the easter eggs to create a feeling of mystery and elation.</p><figure></figure><p id="74d8">Kardashian, this year, has moved away from the shock factor. In 2021 she went faceless, and then in 2022, the Monroe dress caused a huge backlash. In 2023, Kim has taken more of a backseat with a subtler approach. Still a lovely look, but I hope next year we go back to something a bit more risque…</p><p id="88bd"><strong>Lil Nas X</strong></p><p id="3272">I wasn’t too sure how this was a reference to Karl, but I adored the pure drama of it. Nas turned up sprayed head to toe in silver, donning a matching thong and not forgetting the Swarovski crystals. Altogether bamboozling and bedazzling; he created astonishment and humour, and I loved the skipping up and down the carpet. I’m a fan.</p><p id="3d8a">A celebrity like Lil Nas X is destined for Met Gala greatness, he has the silliness and courageousness to go far.

					'Seed Funding Secrets: How to Secure Investments and Skyrocket Your Startup Success • Seed-stage deals rose to about $1.5 billion in 2022, up 86% from $805.2 million in 2021. • The most active multi stage venture firms in seed investing are Greycroft, Founders Fund, and Khosla Ventures. • Most companies raising seed funding are valued at $3 million and $6 million.  Seed funding is the initial capital raised by a startup to develop a product, validate a market, and build a team. Seed funding is often obtained from angel investors, venture capital firms, or crowdfunding campaigns. It’s meant to help a startup get off the ground and ensure it can execute its business plan. Seed funding is also known as initial equity financing. Investors usually provide this funding in exchange for equity stakes and convertible debt.  Seed funding is typically raised in the early stages of a startup’s development when the company is still in the idea or prototype phase and does not yet have any revenue. It is critical for startups as it provides the necessary capital to develop a product, validate a market, build a team, and scale operations. The funds can be used for a variety of purposes, including developing a minimum viable product, conducting market research, hiring a team, building a website, or filing for patents. Without seed funding, startups may struggle to get off the ground, and their chances of success may be greatly diminished.  The amount of seed funding raised can vary widely depending on the nature of the business and the goals of the founders. It is usually the smallest amount of money a company will receive.  Seed investors are individuals or organizations that provide the initial capital or funding to startups in exchange for an ownership stake in the company. Seed investors are typically angel investors or venture capitalists who are willing to take on high-risk investments in the hopes of earning a significant return on their investment. They make investment decisions based on their judgment and experience, not what others might think about a particular company or opportunity.  Seed investors typically invest in startups at the very early stages of development, when the company is still in the ideation or prototype phase and has not yet generated any revenue. Seed investors play a variety of essential roles in the startup ecosystem. They often provide funds to cover the costs of product development, market validation, team building, and scaling operations. They may also offer guidance, mentorship, and networking opportunities to help the startup succeed.  For instance, one of the seed investors, who has experience in the tech industry, may offer to mentor the startup’s CEO on how to scale the business and manage a team effectively using effective technology. Another seed investor, who has a large network of industry contacts, may introduce the startup to potential partners, clients, or investors. A third seed investor, who has a deep understanding of the target market, may offer insights on how to tailor the startup to better fit the needs of customers. By offering such guidance and help, these seed investors can help startups grow and succeed in the competitive world of entrepreneurship.  How Is Seed Funding Different From Growth-Stage Funding?  Seed funding and growth stage funding are two different types of investment stages in a startup’s life cycle.  Seed funding is generally used to help startups launch off the ground by providing enough money to cover overhead costs for a year or so. Seed funds are usually provided by angel investors, who invest their own money into a startup in exchange for partial ownership.  Growth stage funding, on the other hand, is the capital raised by a startup after it has achieved product-market fit and has demonstrated significant growth potential. This type of funding is typically obtained from venture capital firms, private equity firms, or corporate investors. Growth stage funding is used to help startups scale their operations, expand their reach, and attract more customers. The amount of growth stage funding raised is typically much higher than seed funding, and it can be used for a variety of purposes, such as hiring more employees, expanding into new markets, or acquiring other companies.  Therefore, seed funding is the initial capital raised by a startup, while growth stage funding is the capital raised after the startup has achieved and demonstrated significant growth potential. Both types of funding are important for the success of a startup, but they serve different purposes and are obtained from different types of investors.  How Has Seed Funding Exploded In The Last Ten Years?  Less than 3,200 companies garnered seed funding between 2006 and 2010. A decade later, the number ballooned to more than 23,000 startups. That only goes to show that there is a significant increase in seed funding and startups.  Crunchbase data stated that 2009 was the time when seed funding took the lead and began to explode. Do you know what made this remarkable success meet possibilities? One of the leading reasons is the proliferation of technology and the internet. As technology advanced, it became more accessible for people to reach out to others in their community and find support for their ideas. It made it easy to build a network and improve reach. We see more startups than ever because of this, and we expect that trend to continue. There are several reasons for the increase in seed funding for startups in recent years:  Lower Barriers to Entry: The rise of cloud computing, open-source software, and other technologies has significantly lowered the cost of starting a business. This has made it easier for entrepreneurs to launch new ventures and has increased the number of startups seeking seed funding. Increased Entrepreneurship: There has been a cultural shift towards entrepreneurship in recent years, with more people looking to start their own businesses rather than work for established companies. This has led to a surge in the number of startups seeking seed funding. More Investors: The number of angel investors and venture capitalists has increased in recent years, providing more capital for startups at the seed stage. In addition, crowdfunding platforms have emerged, providing another source of seed funding for startups. Potential For High Returns: Seed funding is seen as a high-risk investment, but with the potential for high returns if the startup is successful. This has attracted more investors to the seed funding stage, who are willing to take on the risk in exchange for a potential big payout. Emergence of New Markets: The rise of new markets, such as fintech, healthtech, and edtech, has created opportunities for startups to disrupt traditional industries and create innovative products and services. This has led to an increase in the number of startups seeking seed funding in these sectors.  Many angel investors and venture capital firms have identified that investing in and supporting early-stage startups is a great idea. The momentous success of many tech startups in the past decade has also reinforced the confidence of seed investors in budding startups. Silicon Valley’s largest and most renowned venture firms, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock, and Khosla Ventures, recently announced substantial new dedicated seed funds, illustrating the significance of seed funding and its massive growth.  In this age of lengestartup boom, the need for seed funding is more than just a requirement, it is a necessity. But even with the need to raise seed funds, startups still face challenges.  Seed funding helps startups boost their early operations and start generating revenue, but not all startups succeed in raising these funds. In fact, only a few companies that seek seed funding manage to secure it. Let’s explore why:  Pitching is an essential part of the fundraising process for startups. However, many founders may lack pitching experience, which can make it difficult for them to effectively communicate their business to potential investors. Some founders may struggle with communicating their startup’s value proposition clearly and concisely or may feel nervous or unsure of themselves when presenting to investors.  Sometimes, startup founders may find it difficult to communicate their startup’s story in a way that resonates with investors and may struggle to connect with them during their pitch. Founders may not know how to prepare effectively for investor meetings leading to a weak pitch that hurts their chances of acquiring seed funding. And sometimes, it doesn’t work out as planned because some investors don’t see the potential in the startup ideas or products/services.  Startups fail to impress investors with their product or service strategy. They often lack a clear strategy of how their product or service will differ from similar products or services. An important aspect to keep in mind while seeking funding from seed investors is how to stand out in the market and beat your competition. However, entrepreneurs often cannot articulate why their product or service will be better than what is currently available in the market. Sometimes, founders don’t know their target customers and how to reach them. They also fail to explain how they will make money from their product or service and what specific revenue streams they plan to use. Such lack of clarity can be detrimental to your seed funding opportunities and leave you with no funds to start your business.  The most prominent challenge startups face during acquiring seed funding is their inability to develop a robust business model. A strong business model demonstrates that the startup has a clear understanding of its target market, revenue streams, and costs, and has a plan for achieving profitability. The lack of clarity while defining a business model can ultimately impact a startup’s ability to secure funding.  A weak business model may limit a startup’s ability to invest in growth and innovation. Without a clear understanding of how the startup will generate revenue and cover costs, it may be challenging to justify investing in product development, marketing, or other growth initiatives.  This is a common mistake startups make when trying to secure seed funding. They have a great idea, but they don’t take the time to define their business model effectively. Investors are encouraged to invest in your startup idea when they understand your plan for monetizing it. However, if you don’t take the time to develop an effective business model that can impress investors, it will make them hesitant to shell out money for your startup.  Investors are looking for startups with a clear path to profitability, and an incomplete or weak business model may only push you away from securing this funding. To improve the chances of receiving seed funding, startups should focus on developing a strong business model that demonstrates their understanding of their target market, revenue streams, and costs.  Seed funding is the first step to building a successful startup. However, securing seed funding for your startup can be a challenging and competitive process. But don’t worry because we are here with some effective tips to help you increase your chances of success. Here are some ways to ace the process of seed funding:  1. Know Your Numbers: Before you ask for money, you need to know exactly how much it will cost to get off the ground and how much you will need from investors. You should also have a transparent revenue model or at least a rough outline of how you plan to make money once your product or service is out there.  For instance, if you’re starting a new meal delivery service, seed funding can help you gather data on the number of people in your area who might be interested in using such a service. This information can then be used to estimate your potential revenue and help you make informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and other aspects of your business.  2. An Interactive Pitch: Create an elevator pitch that boils down all the relevant information about your business into one minute or less. Investors will base their decision of funding your startup as per this pitch, so make sure it’s compelling!  For example, if you’re developing a new software application, you might want to create a demonstration video that shows how the product works and how it can benefit users. This interactive pitch could be a game changer for your startup, and encourage investors to give you seed funds.  3. Find Right Investors: Focus on investors interested in supporting your concept rather than just throwing money at any startup they can find. Investors usually specialize in specific industries or types of startups, so try reaching out to those interested in what you’re creating. It would be great if they can also help you with implementing business decisions.  For example, if you’re launching a new e-commerce platform, it is important to obtain seed funding from investors who have experience investing in similar businesses. These investors can provide valuable guidance and connections that can help you grow your startup and reach new customers. Additionally, seed funding can help you establish relationships with investors who share your vision and are committed to helping you succeed.  Seed funding is indeed a boon for startups. One of the primary benefits of seed funding is that it helps to validate a business idea. With seed funding, a startup can conduct market research and develop a prototype. This process enables the business to test the product or service with potential customers, gather feedback, and make necessary changes. By doing this, the startup can be confident that there is a market for its offering, and it can move forward with more substantial investments.  Seed funding is also a crucial step in attracting more investors. Angel investors and venture capitalists are more likely to invest in a startup that has already received seed funding. It serves as proof that the startup has a viable business idea and is committed to making it work, paving the way for the business to raise additional capital in the future.  Seed funding enables a startup to build a strong team. With seed funding, the business can hire skilled professionals, such as engineers, designers, and marketers. This team can help develop the product or service, create a marketing strategy, and build a brand. A strong team is essential for the success of any startup, and seed funding provides the capital needed to attract and retain talented professionals.  Starting a business is risky, and it is common for startups to incur losses in the early stages. Seed funding provides a cushion for these losses, enabling the business to survive and grow, despite some mistakes they make along the journey. Without seed funding, a startup may have to shut down due to financial difficulties.  The amount of money seed funds provide is indeed minimal but super important. The main reason investors give money to startups is because they believe in the potential of the startups and foresee making considerable profits in the future. So, if you are thinking about starting up your own company, you should opt to secure seed funding. It will help you develop your business idea into reality and kick-start your journey towards success. If you are looking for some reliable seed funding, connect with Exitfund.',

This has led to an increase in the number of startups seeking seed funding in these sectors.</p></blockquote><p id="6a5b">Many angel investors and venture capital firms have identified that investing in and supporting early-stage startups is a great idea. The momentous success of many tech startups in the past decade has also reinforced the confidence of seed investors in budding startups. Silicon Valley’s largest and most renowned venture firms, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock, and Khosla Ventures, recently announced substantial new dedicated seed funds, illustrating the significance of seed funding and its massive growth.</p><h2 id="5d7e"><strong>Challenges Faced By Startups While Seeking Seed Funding</strong></h2><p id="023b">In this age of lengestartup boom, the need for seed funding is more than just a requirement, it is a necessity. But even with the need to raise seed funds, startups still face challenges.</p><figure><figcaption><strong>Seed Funding Challenge</strong></figcaption></figure><p id="0932">Seed funding helps startups boost their early operations and start generating revenue, but not all startups succeed in raising these funds. In fact, only a few companies that seek seed funding manage to secure it. Let’s explore why:</p><blockquote><p id="c082"><strong>Lack Of Pitching Experience</strong></p></blockquote><p id="e9a9">Pitching is an essential part of the fundraising process for startups. However, many founders may lack pitching experience, which can make it difficult for them to effectively communicate their business to potential investors. Some founders may struggle with communicating their startup’s value proposition clearly and concisely or may feel nervous or unsure of themselves when presenting to investors.</p><p id="a201">Sometimes, startup founders may find it difficult to communicate their startup’s story in a way that resonates with investors and may struggle to connect with them during their pitch. Founders may not know how to prepare effectively for investor meetings leading to a weak pitch that hurts their chances of acquiring seed funding. And sometimes, it doesn’t work out as planned because some investors don’t see the potential in the startup ideas or products/services.</p><blockquote><p id="a6ce"><strong>Lack Of Clarity In Defining Products Or Services</strong></p></blockquote><p id="37e4">Startups fail to impress investors with their product or service strategy. They often lack a clear strategy of how their product or service will differ from similar products or services. An important aspect to keep in mind while seeking funding from seed investors is how to stand out in the market and beat your competition. However, entrepreneurs often cannot articulate why their product or service will be better than what is currently available in the market. Sometimes, founders don’t know their target customers and how to reach them. They also fail to explain how they will make money from their product or service and what specific revenue streams they plan to use. Such lack of clarity can be detrimental to your seed funding opportunities and leave you with no funds to start your business.</p><blockquote><p id="552c"><strong>An Ineffective Business Model</strong></p></blockquote><p id="bd47">The most prominent challenge startups face during acquiring seed funding is their inability to develop a robust business model. A strong business model demonstrates that the startup has a clear understanding of its target market, revenue streams, and costs, and has a plan for achieving profitability. The lack of clarity while defining a business model can ultimately impact a startup’s ability to secure funding.</p><p id="0f9a">A weak business model may limit a startup’s ability to invest in growth and innovation. Without a clear understanding of how the startup will generate revenue and cover costs, it may be challenging to justify investing in product development, marketing, or other growth initiatives.</p><p id="cb3e">This is a common mistake startups make when trying to secure seed funding. They have a great idea, but they don’t take the time to define their business model effectively. Investors are encouraged to invest in your startup idea when they understand your plan for monetizing it. However, if you don’t take the time to develop an effective business model that can impress investors, it will make them hesitant to shell out money for your startup.</p><p id="3861">Investors are looking for startups with a clear path to profitability, and an incomplete or weak business model may only push you away from securing this funding. To improve the chances of receiving seed funding, startups should focus on developing a strong business model that demonstrates their understanding of their target market, revenue streams, and costs.</p><h2 id="8fbf"><strong>Tips To Ace The Seed Funding Process</strong></h2><p id="0c8c">Seed funding is the first step to building a successful startup. However, securing seed funding for your startup can be a challenging and competitive process. But don’t worry because we are here with some effective tips to help you increase your chances of success. Here are some ways to ace the process of seed funding:</p><figure><figcaption><strong>Best Tips for Seed Funding Process</strong></figcaption></figure><p id="152e"><strong>1. Know Your Numbers: </strong>Before you ask for money, you need to know exactly how much it will cost to get off the ground and how much you will need from investors. You should also have a transparent revenue model or at least a rough outline of how you plan to make money once your product or service is out there.</p><p id="4b0e">For instance, if you’re starting a new meal delivery service, seed funding can help you gather data on the number of people in your area who might be interested in using such a service. This information can then be used to estimate your potential revenue and help you make informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and other aspects of your business.</p><p id="15f3"><strong>2. An Interactive Pitch: </strong>Create an elevator pitch that boils down all the relevant information about your business into one minute or less. Investors will base their decision of funding your startup as per this pitch, so make sure it’s compelling!</p><p id="08c5">For example, if you’re developing a new software application, you might want to create a demonstration video that shows how the product works and how it can benefit users. This interactive pitch could be a game changer for your startup, and encourage investors to give you seed funds.</p><p id="f516"><strong>3. Find Right Investors: </strong>Focus on investors interested in supporting your concept rather than just throwing money at any startup they can find. Investors usually specialize in specific industries or types of startups, so try reaching out to those interested in what you’re creating. It would be great if they can also help you with implementing business decisions.</p><p id="c903">For example, if you’re launching a new e-commerce platform, it is important to obtain seed funding from investors who have experience investing in similar businesses. These investors can provide valuable guidance and connections that can help you grow your startup and reach new customers. Additionally, seed funding can help you establish relationships with investors who share your vision and are committed to helping you succeed.</p><h2 id="b90a"><strong>Wrap Up</strong></h2><p id="2bc8">Seed funding is indeed a boon for startups. One of the primary benefits of seed funding is that it helps to validate a business idea. With seed funding, a startup can conduct market research and develop a prototype. This process enables the business to test the product or service with potential customers, gather feedback, and make necessary changes. By doing this, the startup can be confident that there is a market for its offering, and it can move forward with more substantial investments.</p><p id="96d3">Seed funding is also a crucial step in attracting more investors. Angel investors and venture capitalists are more likely to invest in a startup that has already received seed funding. It serves as proof that the startup has a viable business idea and is committed to making it work, paving the way for the business to raise additional capital in the future.</p><p id="69c0">Seed funding enables a startup to build a strong team. With seed funding, the business can hire skilled professionals, such as engineers, designers, and marketers. This team can help develop the product or service, create a marketing strategy, and build a brand. A strong team is essential for the success of any startup, and seed funding provides the capital needed to attract and retain talented professionals.</p><p id="154c">Starting a business is risky, and it is common for startups to incur losses in the early stages. Seed funding provides a cushion for these losses, enabling the business to survive and grow, despite some mistakes they make along the journey. Without seed funding, a startup may have to shut down due to financial difficulties.</p><p id="80f3">The amount of money seed funds provide is indeed minimal but super important. The main reason investors give money to startups is because they believe in the potential of the startups and foresee making considerable profits in the future. So, if you are thinking about starting up your own company, you should opt to secure seed funding. It will help you develop your business idea into reality and kick-start your journey towards success.

					'The Rise of AI: How it’s Replacing Jobs and What You Can Do About It  As an AI assistant, I am keenly aware of the impact that artificial intelligence is having on the job market. AI is revolutionizing the way we work, making certain jobs obsolete and creating new opportunities. In this article, I will explore the current state of AI and job displacement, the industries most affected by AI job replacement, the benefits of AI in the workplace, and how you can prepare for AI job displacement. I will also examine jobs that are safe from AI replacement, government and business response to AI job displacement, ethical considerations of AI replacing jobs, and the future of AI and the job market.  Introduction to AI and its Impact on Job Market  Artificial intelligence has been a buzzword for several years now, and it is no secret that AI is changing the way we live and work. AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. AI is rapidly advancing and has already started to replace jobs that were once performed by humans. The impact of AI on the job market is significant, and it is a trend that is unlikely to slow down anytime soon.  The current state of AI and job displacement is a cause for concern for many people. According to a report by McKinsey, up to 800 million jobs could be replaced by automation by 2030. This number is significant and shows the scale of the impact that AI is having on the job market. The jobs most at risk of being replaced by AI are those that involve routine, repetitive tasks, such as data entry, assembly line work, and customer service.  However, it is not just low-skilled jobs that are at risk. AI is also replacing high-skilled jobs such as financial analysts, lawyers, and doctors. For example, in the legal industry, AI is being used to review contracts and perform legal research, tasks that were once done by junior lawyers. While AI is not yet capable of replacing all aspects of these jobs, it is clear that the impact of AI on the job market is significant and widespread.  The impact of AI on the job market is not evenly distributed across all industries. Some industries are more affected than others. The industries most affected by AI job replacement are those that involve routine, repetitive tasks, such as manufacturing, retail, and customer service. These industries are already seeing significant job losses due to automation.  However, it is not just low-skilled jobs that are at risk. High-skilled jobs such as finance and healthcare are also at risk of being replaced by AI. For example, AI is being used to analyze complex financial data and make investment decisions, tasks that were once done by human financial analysts. In healthcare, AI is being used to diagnose diseases and recommend treatment plans, tasks that were once done by doctors.  Benefits of AI in the Workplace  While the impact of AI on the job market is significant, it is not all bad news. AI has many benefits in the workplace. One of the most significant benefits of AI is increased efficiency. AI can perform tasks much faster than humans, and it does not need breaks or time off. This means that AI can help companies save time and money by performing tasks that would otherwise require human labor.  Another benefit of AI in the workplace is increased accuracy. AI is less prone to errors than humans, especially when it comes to performing repetitive tasks. This means that companies can rely on AI to perform tasks that require a high degree of accuracy, such as data entry and quality control.  Finally, AI can also help companies make better decisions. AI can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns and trends that humans might miss. This means that companies can use AI to make more informed decisions about everything from inventory management to marketing strategy.  As AI continues to replace jobs, it is essential to prepare for job displacement. One way to prepare for AI job displacement is by upskilling and reskilling. Upskilling refers to the process of learning new skills that are relevant to the changing job market. Reskilling refers to the process of learning entirely new skills that are not related to your current job.  Upskilling and reskilling can help individuals stay relevant in the job market by acquiring skills that are in demand. For example, individuals who work in customer service can upskill by learning how to use AI-powered chatbots to provide customer support. Individuals who work in manufacturing can reskill by learning how to program and maintain robots used in production.  While AI is replacing many jobs, there are still some jobs that are safe from AI replacement. These jobs typically require a high degree of creativity, emotional intelligence, and social interaction. Jobs that involve caring for others, such as nurses and social workers, are less likely to be replaced by AI. Jobs that involve creativity, such as artists and writers, are also less likely to be replaced by AI.  Another category of jobs that are safe from AI replacement is jobs that involve physical work. While robots can perform many physical tasks, they are not yet capable of performing all physical tasks. Jobs that involve manual dexterity, such as plumbers and electricians, are less likely to be replaced by AI.  The impact of AI on the job market has not gone unnoticed by governments and businesses. Many governments have started to develop policies to address the impact of AI on the job market. For example, some governments have introduced retraining programs to help workers acquire new skills. Some governments have also introduced policies to encourage companies to invest in AI responsibly.  Businesses have also started to take action to address the impact of AI on the job market. Some companies have introduced retraining programs for their employees. Other companies have started to invest in AI responsibly, by ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared with their employees and society as a whole.  The impact of AI on the job market raises several ethical considerations. One of the most significant ethical considerations is the impact of AI on income inequality. If AI continues to replace jobs, there is a risk that income inequality will increase. Those who are unable to acquire the skills necessary to work in an AI-driven economy may be left behind.  Another ethical consideration is the impact of AI on privacy. AI relies on data to perform tasks, and there is a risk that AI could be used to invade people’s privacy. For example, AI could be used to analyze individuals’ social media activity to make hiring decisions.  The future of AI and the job market is unpredictable. While AI is replacing jobs today, there is no guarantee that this trend will continue in the future. As AI continues to evolve, it is likely that new jobs will be created that do not yet exist. It is also possible that AI will be used to augment human work rather than replace it.  The rise of AI and its impact on the job market is a topic of significant concern for many people. While AI is replacing many jobs today, there is no need to panic. AI has many benefits in the workplace, and it is likely that new jobs will be created in the future. However, it is essential to prepare for AI job displacement by upskilling and reskilling. Governments and businesses also have a role to play in ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared with everyone. As an AI assistant, I am confident that AI will continue to revolutionize the way we work, and I look forward to seeing the positive impact that AI will have on society.',

					'Fire in Tunnels: A Primer On Fire Safety Down Below  Tunnels present unique considerations in terms of fire safety, particularly due to the confined spaces and restrictive ventilation. Being involved in the design of the electrical life safety systems in Tunnels for the last 20 years from an electrical code compliance and fire resistive cabling systems aspect. Fire in a tunnel can quickly become a life threatening situation, as the smoke and heat can quickly fill the cavity, making it difficult for people to egress to safety.  Tunnel Fires In The Know  Tunnel fires are known to generate intense heat, smoke, and toxic gases, which travels rapidly throughout the tunnel and can affect large masses of people, whether a Subway, Rail or Road tunnel. The “front and center” factors that add to the threat level of a tunnel fire are inclusive of the type and quantity of combustible materials in the tunnel, the ventilation system functionality, and the geometry of the tunnel (length, round, square, dual, etc).  According to a study by N. Hua, and others in 2020 [4], the temperature of a fire in a tunnel can exceed 1000 °C (1832 F), which is hot enough to cause significant damage to the tunnel structure, and it’s infrastructure, and generate toxic gases (types and concentration depending on materials). The ventilation system can play a very critical role in controlling the spread of both heat and smoke, but it can as a result in the spread of the fire if the airflow is not managed properly.  Designing fire-resistive tunnels requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving professionals in Civil, Structural, Fire, HVAC and Electrical Engineering. First and foremost, the tunnel structure has to beable to resist the thermal temperature rise stress and continuity of heat without fear of collapse.  According to Cafaro and Bertola (2019)[1], the historic design approach for fire-resistive tunnels has been to utilizing passive fire protection, such as fire-resistant, or fire proof materials (panels, et..) and coatings, to help the tunnel structure resist the heat. This approach no matter how functional may not protect tunnel users from the toxic smoke and gases generated.  Engineers and Designers are now reviewing and utilizing active fire protection processes, such as smoke control systems, to reduce limit the smoke and toxic gases in the tunnel and support visibility for tunnel egress by civilians, and firefighting location accuracy by fire professionals. A study by Junmei Li, and others in 2021 [9] noted that smoke control systems have shown to limit the spread of smoke and heat in a tunnel during a fire condition, however, how well they work depends on the geometry of the tunnel and the scale of the ventilation system.  “How To” For Risk Control of Fires in Tunnels  The strategies that engineers can employ to reduce risk of fires in tunnels, and meanwhile protection human life, in the event of a fire.  1) Reduce the amount of combustible materials in the design or retrofit, by using non-combustible materials in the tunnel lining system, and avoid flammable liquids and gases in the tunnel when possible [10] [11]  2) Upgrade, or redesign, the ventilation to reduce the risk of fire by slowing down the spread of smoke and heat. Per NFPA 130 and NFPA 502 standards [13], tunnels should have a strong designed ventilation system, that meets or exceeds the standards, that can control smoke and heat in the event of a fire. Active ventilation systems include fans and air ducts, which can be used to control the airflow and reduce the spread of smoke and heat..  3) The ventilation system should be designed to create a negative pressure zone that prevents smoke and gases from moving to other sections of the tunnel, and still providing fresh air to people who are attempting an egress path from the tunnel. Depending on the design, natural ventilation could be used to create this negative pressure, however in larger tunnels mechanical ventilation systems is the only way to achieve this effect.  In the Runehamar tunnel fire tests [11] ventilation system plays a big role in mitigating the negative results of tunnel fires. Good ventilation design and operation procedures, help make the point that the design of ventilation systems should consider the geometry and operation of the tunnel, fire scenarios, and the movement of people and vehicles.  Most tunnel designers know that there is a potential for smoke to accumulate in low areas of the tunnel, known as stratification (ie.. a layer of warm air collects at tunnel ceiling level. As the smoke from a fire rises, it reaches this thermal block and lacks the energy to rise further. The smoke then builds up below the level of the of the block, creating a smoke plateau.) This can make it difficult for people to egress and can also accelerate the spread of fire. Smoke extraction fans can be installed to extricate the smoke from these low areas and prevent the stratification.  Proper emergency lighting can save the day. In the event of a power outage, emergency lighting can help guide people either out of the tunnel or to a place of shelter. As per NFPA 502, emergency lighting should be installed “at intervals not greater than 30 ft (9.1 m) along all means of egress.” The lighting should be designed to provide adequate illumination for at least 1.5 hours after a power outage.[14]  Fires in tunnels are extremely dangerous, and pose significant challenges for first responders, tunnel operators, and people stuck in the tunnel. The situational conditions of a fire depend on numerous factors, including the types of materials in the tunnel, the ventilation network, and the integrity and design of the tunnel’s fire protection systems.  Recent tunnel designs and construction processes can improve tunnel safety, maximize and speed-up evacuation procedures, and mitigate the risk of tunnel fires. Maintenance of tunnel fire protection systems must be handled on a regimented schedule for the protection of everyone.  Teamwork between stakeholders, government, and fire agency researchers is important in promoting tunnel safety and reducing tunnel fires and the risks of fatalities and injury. • “Fires in Tunnels: Learning from Disasters” by Emilio Cafaro Dipartimento di Energetica, Politecnico di Torino Volfango Bertola School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259800966_Fires_in_Tunnels_Learning_from_Disasters • “Characterizing damage in a concrete lining during a tunnel fire” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. published in the journal Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology in 2021: https://engineering.buffalo.edu/civil-structural-environmental/research/research-news-highlights.host.html/content/shared/engineering/civil-structural-environmental/research/research-highlights/tunnel-fire-project.detail.html • “A review of tunnel fire damage assessment methods and techniques” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. published in the Transportation Research Record in 2021: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0361198120987228 • “Quantifying uncertainties in the temperature-time evolution of railway tunnel fires” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. published in the journal Fire Technology in 2020: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10694-020-01007-8 • “Tunnel Fire Damage Assessment: A Review” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. presented at the 100th Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting in 2021:https://trid.trb.org/view/1759383 • “Damage assessment framework for tunnel structures under fire” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. presented at the 11th International Conference on Structures in Fire in 2020: https://engineering.buffalo.edu/civil-structural-environmental/research/geomechanics-geotechnical-and-geoenvironmental-engineering.host.html/content/shared/engineering/civil-structural-environmental/research/research-highlights/tunnel-fire-project.detail.html • “Design fire scenarios for railway tunnel fires” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. presented at the IABSE Congress in 2019: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335662563_Design_Fire_Scenarios_for_Railway_Tunnel_Fires • “Enhancing the resilience of tunnels subject to fire events” presented at the AASHTO Committee on Bridges and Structures Annual Meeting in 2021: https://www.tunnel-online.info/en/artikel/tunnel_Fire_Protection_for_new_and_existing_Underground_Structures-329612.html • “Numerical evaluation on the smoke control strategies and parameters for the road tunnel with converging junctions” by Junmei Li, Qiwei Dong, Yanfeng Li, and Zehang Wang, published in the journal Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology in 2021: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705817349226 • Experimental Study on the Effectiveness of Mechanical Smoke Exhaust in a Long Tunnel under Fire Conditions.

Being involved in the design of the electrical life safety systems in Tunnels for the last 20 years from an electrical code compliance and fire resistive cabling systems aspect. Fire in a tunnel can quickly become a life threatening situation, as the smoke and heat can quickly fill the cavity, making it difficult for people to egress to safety.</p><h2 id="154a">Tunnel Fires In The Know</h2><p id="aeac">Tunnel fires are known to generate intense heat, smoke, and toxic gases, which travels rapidly throughout the tunnel and can affect large masses of people, whether a Subway, Rail or Road tunnel. The “front and center” factors that add to the threat level of a tunnel fire are inclusive of the type and quantity of combustible materials in the tunnel, the ventilation system functionality, and the geometry of the tunnel (length, round, square, dual, etc).</p><p id="20d0">According to a study by N. Hua, and others in 2020 [4], the temperature of a fire in a tunnel can exceed 1000 °C (1832 F), which is hot enough to cause significant damage to the tunnel structure, and it’s infrastructure, and generate toxic gases (types and concentration depending on materials). The ventilation system can play a very critical role in controlling the spread of both heat and smoke, but it can as a result in the spread of the fire if the airflow is not managed properly.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="cdd3">Odyssey In Designing Fire-Safe Tunnels</h2><p id="7e2a">Designing fire-resistive tunnels requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving professionals in Civil, Structural, Fire, HVAC and Electrical Engineering. First and foremost, the tunnel structure has to beable to resist the thermal temperature rise stress and continuity of heat without fear of collapse.</p><p id="4a47">According to Cafaro and Bertola (2019)[1], the historic design approach for fire-resistive tunnels has been to utilizing passive fire protection, such as fire-resistant, or fire proof materials (panels, et..) and coatings, to help the tunnel structure resist the heat. This approach no matter how functional may not protect tunnel users from the toxic smoke and gases generated.</p><p id="1afd">Engineers and Designers are now reviewing and utilizing active fire protection processes, such as smoke control systems, to reduce limit the smoke and toxic gases in the tunnel and support visibility for tunnel egress by civilians, and firefighting location accuracy by fire professionals. A study by Junmei Li, and others in 2021 [9] noted that smoke control systems have shown to limit the spread of smoke and heat in a tunnel during a fire condition, however, how well they work depends on the geometry of the tunnel and the scale of the ventilation system.</p><h2 id="6daf">“How To” For Risk Control of Fires in Tunnels</h2><p id="b0ba">The strategies that engineers can employ to reduce risk of fires in tunnels, and meanwhile protection human life, in the event of a fire.</p><p id="2d65">1) Reduce the amount of combustible materials in the design or retrofit, by using non-combustible materials in the tunnel lining system, and avoid flammable liquids and gases in the tunnel when possible [10] [11]</p><p id="bad7">2) Upgrade, or redesign, the ventilation to reduce the risk of fire by slowing down the spread of smoke and heat. Per NFPA 130 and NFPA 502 standards [13], tunnels should have a strong designed ventilation system, that meets or exceeds the standards, that can control smoke and heat in the event of a fire. Active ventilation systems include fans and air ducts, which can be used to control the airflow and reduce the spread of smoke and heat..</p><p id="e14e">3) The ventilation system should be designed to create a negative pressure zone that prevents smoke and gases from moving to other sections of the tunnel, and still providing fresh air to people who are attempting an egress path from the tunnel. Depending on the design, natural ventilation could be used to create this negative pressure, however in larger tunnels mechanical ventilation systems is the only way to achieve this effect.</p><figure></figure><p id="6dbd">In the Runehamar tunnel fire tests [11] ventilation system plays a big role in mitigating the negative results of tunnel fires. Good ventilation design and operation procedures, help make the point that the design of ventilation systems should consider the geometry and operation of the tunnel, fire scenarios, and the movement of people and vehicles.</p><p id="438b">Most tunnel designers know that there is a potential for smoke to accumulate in low areas of the tunnel, known as stratification (ie.. a layer of warm air collects at tunnel ceiling level. As the smoke from a fire rises, it reaches this thermal block and lacks the energy to rise further. The smoke then builds up below the level of the of the block, creating a smoke plateau.) This can make it difficult for people to egress and can also accelerate the spread of fire. Smoke extraction fans can be installed to extricate the smoke from these low areas and prevent the stratification.</p><p id="eca6">Proper emergency lighting can save the day. In the event of a power outage, emergency lighting can help guide people either out of the tunnel or to a place of shelter. As per NFPA 502, emergency lighting should be installed “at intervals not greater than 30 ft (9.1 m) along all means of egress.” The lighting should be designed to provide adequate illumination for at least 1.5 hours after a power outage.[14]</p><figure></figure><h2 id="2bba">End Of The Tunnel</h2><p id="feed">Fires in tunnels are extremely dangerous, and pose significant challenges for first responders, tunnel operators, and people stuck in the tunnel. The situational conditions of a fire depend on numerous factors, including the types of materials in the tunnel, the ventilation network, and the integrity and design of the tunnel’s fire protection systems.</p><p id="01d8">Recent tunnel designs and construction processes can improve tunnel safety, maximize and speed-up evacuation procedures, and mitigate the risk of tunnel fires. Maintenance of tunnel fire protection systems must be handled on a regimented schedule for the protection of everyone.</p><p id="ef23">Teamwork between stakeholders, government, and fire agency researchers is important in promoting tunnel safety and reducing tunnel fires and the risks of fatalities and injury.</p><h2 id="bed1">References:</h2><ol><li id="3179">“Fires in Tunnels: Learning from Disasters” by Emilio Cafaro Dipartimento di Energetica, Politecnico di Torino Volfango Bertola School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh: <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259800966_Fires_in_Tunnels_Learning_from_Disasters">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259800966_Fires_in_Tunnels_Learning_from_Disasters</a></li><li id="b53a">“Characterizing damage in a concrete lining during a tunnel fire” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. published in the journal Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology in 2021: <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/civil-structural-environmental/research/research-news-highlights.host.html/content/shared/engineering/civil-structural-environmental/research/research-highlights/tunnel-fire-project.detail.html">https://engineering.buffalo.edu/civil-structural-environmental/research/research-news-highlights.host.html/content/shared/engineering/civil-structural-environmental/research/research-highlights/tunnel-fire-project.detail.html</a></li><li id="5bf9">“A review of tunnel fire damage assessment methods and techniques” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. published in the Transportation Research Record in 2021: <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0361198120987228">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0361198120987228</a></li><li id="f958">“Quantifying uncertainties in the temperature-time evolution of railway tunnel fires” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. published in the journal Fire Technology in 2020: <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10694-020-01007-8">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10694-020-01007-8</a></li><li id="49fb">“Tunnel Fire Damage Assessment: A Review” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. presented at the 100th Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting in 2021:https://trid.trb.org/view/1759383</li><li id="957f">“Damage assessment framework for tunnel structures under fire” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. presented at the 11th International Conference on Structures in Fire in 2020: <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/civil-structural-environmental/research/geomechanics-geotechnical-and-geoenvironmental-engineering.host.html/content/shared/engineering/civil-structural-environmental/research/research-highlights/tunnel-fire-project.detail.html">https://engineering.buffalo.edu/civil-structural-environmental/research/geomechanics-geotechnical-and-geoenvironmental-engineering.host.html/content/shared/engineering/civil-structural-environmental/research/research-highlights/tunnel-fire-project.detail.html</a></li><li id="e67c">“Design fire scenarios for railway tunnel fires” by Hua, N., Tessari, A., Elhami Khorasani, N. presented at the IABSE Congress in 2019: <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335662563_Design_Fire_Scenarios_for_Railway_Tunnel_Fires">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335662563_Design_Fire_Scenarios_for_Railway_Tunnel_Fires</a></li><li id="60f7">“Enhancing the resilience of tunnels subject to fire events” presented at the AASHTO Committee on Bridges and Structures Annual Meeting in 2021: <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" href="https://www.tunnel-online.info/en/artikel/tunnel_Fire_Protection_for_new_and_existing_Underground_Structures-329612.html">https://www.tunnel-online.info/en/artikel/tunnel_Fire_Protection_for_new_and_existing_Underground_Structures-329612.html</a></li><li id="e593">“Numerical evaluation on the smoke control strategies and parameters for the road tunnel with converging junctions” by Junmei Li, Qiwei Dong, Yanfeng Li, and Zehang Wang, published in the journal Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology in 2021: <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705817349226">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705817349226</a></li><li id="601d">Experimental Study on the Effectiveness of Mechanical Smoke Exhaust in a Long Tunnel under Fire Conditions.

					'Hackers have seized on worldwide interest in the artificial intelligence-powered tool ChatGPT in an effort to break into people’s devices, Facebook owner Meta revealed in a security report Wednesday, equating the phenomenon to the surge in cryptocurrency scams.  Meta’s security team said it found hackers software that claimed to offer ChatGPT-based tools via browser extensions and online app stores that contained malware designed to give hackers access to people’s devices, Meta said.  “From a bad actor’s perspective, ChatGPT is the new crypto,” Guy Rosen, Meta’s chief information security officer, told reporters, meaning scammers have quickly moved to exploit interest in the technology.  Since March alone, the company said it had blocked the sharing of more than 1,000 malicious web addresses that claimed to be linked to ChatGPT or related tools.  Some of the tools include working ChatGPT features but also contain malicious code to infect users’ devices.  Meta said it had “investigated and taken action against malware strains taking advantage of people’s interest in OpenAI’s ChatGPT to trick them into installing malware pretending to provide AI functionality.”  “Our research and that of security researchers has shown time and again that malware operators, just like spammers, try to latch onto hot-button issues and popular topics to get people’s attention,” it said. “With an ultimate goal to trick people into clicking on malicious links or downloading malicious software, the latest wave of malware campaigns have taken notice of generative AI tools becoming popular.”',

					'The White House on Thursday announced a series of measures to address the challenges of artificial intelligence, driven by the sudden popularity of tools such as ChatGPT and amid rising concerns about the technology’s potential risks for discrimination, misinformation and privacy.  The US government plans to introduce policies that shape how federal agencies procure and use AI systems, the White House said. The step could significantly influence the market for AI products and control how Americans interact with AI on government websites, at security checkpoints and in other settings.  The National Science Foundation will also spend $140 million to promote research and development in AI, the White House added. The funds will be used to create research centers that seek to apply AI to issues such as climate change, agriculture and public health, according to the administration.  The plan comes the same day that Vice President Kamala Harris and other administration officials are expected to meet with the CEOs of Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT-creator OpenAI and Anthropic to emphasize the importance of ethical and responsible AI development. And it coincides with a UK government inquiry launched Thursday into the risks and benefits of AI.  “Tech companies have a fundamental responsibility to make sure their products are safe and secure, and that they protect people’s rights before they’re deployed or made public,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters on a conference call.  Officials cited a range of risks the public faces in the widespread adoption of AI tools, including the possible use of AI-created deepfakes and misinformation that could undermine the democratic process. Job losses linked to rising automation, biased algorithmic decision-making, physical dangers arising from autonomous vehicles and the threat of AI-powered malicious hackers are also on the White House’s list of concerns.  It’s just the latest example of the federal government acknowledging concerns from the rapid development and deployment of new AI tools, and trying to find ways to address some of the risks.  Testifying before Congress, members of the Federal Trade Commission have argued AI could “turbocharge” fraud and scams. Its chair, Lina Khan, wrote in a New York Times op-ed this week that the US government has ample existing legal authority to regulate AI by leaning on its mandate to protect consumers and competition.  Last year, the Biden administration unveiled a proposal for an AI Bill of Rights calling for developers to respect the principles of privacy, safety and equal rights as they create new AI tools.  Earlier this year, the Commerce Department released voluntary risk management guidelines for AI that it said could help organizations and businesses “govern, map, measure and manage” the potential dangers in each part of the development cycle. In April, the Department also said it is seeking public input on the best policies for regulating AI, including through audits and industry self-regulation.  The US government isn’t alone in seeking to shape AI development. European officials anticipate hammering out AI legislation as soon as this year that could have major implications for AI companies around the world.',

					'A Manhattan jury found Ed Sheeran’s hit “Thinking Out Loud” did not infringe on the copyright of the classic Marvin Gaye song “Let’s Get It On.”  The jury determined that Sheeran did not wrongfully copy compositional elements or melodies from “Let’s Get It On.” The jury found that Sheeran independently created his song.  Sheeran later said he is “obviously very happy with the outcome of the case,” adding “it looks like I’m not having to retire from my day job after all.”  “But at the same time I’m unbelievably frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all,” he said. Sheeran said eight years were spent talking about two songs with “dramatically” different lyrics melodies “and four chords which are also different and used by songwriters everyday all over the world.”  The trial concerned Sheeran’s song “Thinking Out Loud,” which won the 2016 Grammy award for song of the year. The family of Ed Townsend, who co-wrote “Let’s Get It On” with Gaye, had accused Sheeran of copying the 1973 hit.  The plaintiffs had alleged similarities between the chord progression, harmonic rhythm, and certain melodies in the two songs. Sheeran’s legal team had argued that the melodies are different and the elements used in both songs are common in pop music.  The case was closely watched for its potential to further complicate the legal landscape for songwriters, after a number of high-profile music copyright lawsuits in recent years.  During the trial, Sheeran performed the opening line of “Thinking Out Loud” for the jury in an attempt to rebut the testimony of the plaintiff’s expert witness. Sheeran also said he found the allegations in the case “really insulting.”  Sheeran testified that he and co-writer Amy Wadge wrote “Thinking Out Loud” in less than a day in February 2014 when Wadge was staying at his house in the UK.  Sheeran said he and Wadge both had relatives who were ill or had recently died, and thinking about their long marriages served as inspiration for the song.  Ben Crump, a lawyer representing the family of the co-writer for Gaye’s 1973 hit “Let’s Get It On,” said in his opening statement that Sheeran played his ballad and Gaye’s song back-to-back in a medley during a concert, and called the moment a “smoking gun.”  During his testimony, Sheeran said the idea of creating the medley was “probably mine.” He said if he had, indeed, copied “Let’s Get It On,” then he “would’ve been an idiot to stand on stage in front of 20,000 people.”  Music copyright lawsuits have become increasingly common in the music industry over the past few years.  Gaye’s family has previously sued other artists for copyright infringement—and won. The estate successfully sued singer Robin Thicke and producer Pharrell Williams for $7.4 million in 2015 for borrowing from Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up” for their hit “Blurred Lines,” though the case turned into a five-year legal battle that ultimately saw the judgment reduced to $5.3 million. The ruling also awarded Gaye’s family 50% percent of the royalties from “Blurred Lines” moving forward.  But other, recent copyright cases have had different outcomes.  Taylor Swift faced a similar case in 2017 over her smash hit “Shake It Off,” which was settled and dismissed last year. Led Zeppelin was sued in 2014 over its iconic tune “Stairway to Heaven” by the estate of late Randy California, former lead guitarist of the 1960s band Spirit, for lifting part of their single “Taurus.” A 2020 appeals court ruled in Led Zeppelin’s favor.  Sheeran, meanwhile, has faced previous legal battles over his music and won. In a 2022 case over his song “Shape of You,” a judge ruled in Sheeran’s favor that he did not copy grime artist Sami Switch’s song “Oh Why” after the musician accused Sheeran of plagiarizing a key part. He was also sued in 2016 over his single “Photograph,” which was settled out of court.  After his successful 2022 legal battle, Sheeran posted a video to his Instagram voicing his concern over the recent wave of music copyright cases, calling it “really damaging to the songwriting industry.”  On Thursday, Sheeran and Kathryn Townsend Griffin, a plaintiff in the case, hugged and spoke at length after the jury returned the verdict.  “I’m glad that we could hug this thing out,” Griffin said after court. She added that Sheeran had invited her to one of his upcoming shows.',

Get news about destinations opening, inspiration for future adventures, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.  As Saudi Arabia continues its drive to attract tourists, authorities in the country appear to be reaching out to a particularly lucrative section of the market: LGBTQ travelers.  The website of the Saudi Tourism Authority (STA) seems to have had its Q&A section updated to state that gay visitors are welcome in the kingdom.  “Everyone is welcome to visit Saudi Arabia and visitors are not asked to disclose such personal details,” is the website’s response to the question on its FAQ page: “Are LGBT visitors welcome to visit Saudi Arabia?”  It is not known exactly when the website was updated. A spokesperson for the STA said the policy had previously been in place, but an archived version of the website on March 14, 2023 and before did not have the question and answer on the page.  Same-sex sexual activity is an offense in Saudi Arabia, according to Human Rights Watch.  According to the Human Dignity Trust, which campaigns for the rights of LGBT people around the world, trans people can also face prosecution in Saudi, with “substantial evidence of the law being enforced” and “consistent reports of discrimination and violence” against LGBTQ people.  LGBTQ+ travelers are a lucrative market, according to Darren Burn, CEO of Out Of Office, a luxury travel planning service for the community, and of Travel Gay, the world’s largest LGBTQ+ travel platform.  “Research shows they spend more money in a destination than heterosexual couples, and tend to travel more times a year,” he told CNN.  “It’s a very interesting and lucrative demographic, and countries are plowing major revenue into [attracting] it.”  Whether LGBTQ travelers will feel comfortable traveling to Saudi, however, is another matter. Burn said that destinations such as the Maldives and Dubai, where homosexuality is a criminal offense, are popular, but without more assurances from the authorities, Saudi Arabia could be a tougher sell.  “It’s pretty vague, and doesn’t offer the assurances that would make me feel able to send our clients safely to the destination, but anything on the website about LGBT travelers is a good starting point,” he said.  “I can’t think of another Middle Eastern tourist board that has even mentioned them, except Qatar in the run-up to the World Cup, and even that was vague, saying that everyone was welcome.  “But my concern is what the reality is like in the destination. Are they saying that a same-sex couple can check into a hotel and get a double bed without any issues? My hunch would be that that’s not the reality.”  One gay traveler who visited Saudi Arabia on a work trip in October 2022 – before the website was updated – told CNN that he felt “in the closet” during his stay.  The UK traveler – who did not want to be named – spent time in AlUla, one of Saudi’s tourism-focused destinations.  “It was OK for a week or so but after that I suddenly realized it gone back to living a life in the closet and not being my true self. More out of fear of what might happen – the unknown – rather than anything specific that happened,” he said.  “I was sent an email [by the company I was working for] with what I should do. They basically told me to delete anything even remotely LGBTQI related from my phone – all photos, apps, newspapers and magazines. My Egyptian friend suggested I just get a new clean phone.  “I told close colleagues, but I wasn’t [generally] talking about being gay, or my past experience. I kept it to myself, and suddenly realized that I wasn’t able to talk about what I would normally talk about, and that’s not how I want to live. In practice everyone was very relaxed, but the law’s the law.”  However, he added that one “revelation” from his trip was “how friendly and welcoming the Saudi people were.  “They’re really open to changing attitudes, but they haven’t really [been in contact] with the Western world in their lifetimes. Unless you meet people [from other cultures] and talk about differences there’s no way of learning from them.  “I found that what the law and the authorities say is very different to how the locals interact with you.  “If you were to go there and be overtly gay I’d be quite concerned – I wouldn’t feel comfortable going there with a partner – but it’s a country that’s changing very quickly.”  Saudi Arabia is focusing on expanding its tourism sector, appealing to archaeology fans at the likes of AlUla, where ruins have been left untouched for almost 2,000 years, and creating entire new cities to appeal to visitors.  CNN’s Richard Quest, who visited in September 2022, wrote that: “I have seen countries change before, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like the change taking place in Saudi Arabia. Saudi’s change is deliberate, deep-reaching and dramatic.” He also flagged its “contradictions,” however – after his visit, 81 people were executed in a single day.  Human rights researcher Nora Noralla told CNN that the kingdom is following Qatar and Dubai in its bid to attract LGBTQ+ travelers. But she warned that it might not be on the travelers’ terms.  “In Dubai there are a lot of gay influencers, and as long as you understand the context of the area you’re in and respect the traditional culture and not show your queerness in any way, you’re OK,” she said.  “That requires you to be cis-passing. If you show up and you’re non-binary, or male with makeup on, or obviously trans, and come to the region you’ll be denied entrance. I wouldn’t say LGBT people are welcome – they say same-sex couples are welcome, and that’s entirely different.”  She also warned that what goes for “rich tourists” doesn’t fly for others. “Queer residents know what lines they can cross, and it’s all down to your economic and social background,” she said. “They realize the risks with this kind of activity and know how to do it in a discreet way. This [the new move] is basically for Western tourists.  “They’re trying to copy the Dubai model so they can get some of their money. There’s a lot of competition [for money]. If you’re a cis, gay Westerner you’re welcome. If you’re trans and cis-passing, you’re welcome. But anything that remotely shows your queerness, you’re not. And I think if anyone crosses a line, they will definitely act swiftly.”  Despite his skepticism, Darren Burn thinks Saudi could potentially be a gay-friendly destination.  “We’d welcome a conversation with the tourist board and government to work out a way that LGBTQ+ travelers can genuinely travel in a safe way, to see them put money behind promoting to LGBT communities, and making changes to LGBT rights locally to make Saudi Arabia an authentic destination that appeals.  “We all know the reason destinations are welcoming tourists now is because they think that’s their future income stream, but that’s good, because it might drive changes in equality law if it’s good for business.”  He added that travel can broaden minds on both sides.  “Without travel and tourists coming to the destinations, mindsets would never change – as long as they can do so safely, LGBTQ+ travelers can break down barriers,” he said.  “Destinations do change – but I don’t think we’d be sending customers any time soon until we can receive assurances that they’d be safe, welcome and able to check in.”  An STA spokesperson said in a statement: “Everyone is welcome to visit Saudi, provided that they follow and respect our culture, traditions and laws, as you would when you visit any other country in the world.  “Like other governments, we do not ask visitors personal questions and we respect the right to privacy.”',
