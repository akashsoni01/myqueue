A study published in January found that billionaires aren’t any smarter than the rest of us – indeed, those in the top 1% of earners scored lower on cognitive ability tests than those who earned slightly less.  This is according to researchers who analysed data from 59,000 Swedish men, then tracked their lives for more than a decade. They found a strong connection between how smart someone was and how much they earned – until they reached a salary of 600,000 kronor (£46,700) a year. After that, factors such as luck, background and personality became more important.  “Along an important dimension of merit – cognitive ability – we find no evidence that those with top jobs that pay extraordinary wages are more deserving than those who earn only half those wages,” the researchers noted.  Unless your primary hobby is licking billionaires’ boots, I am sure none of this is particularly surprising. Indeed, you need only look at Elon Musk’s Twitter feed to realise that being obscenely rich doesn’t automatically equate to being incredibly intelligent.  Still, considering the soaring pay gap between CEOs and workers, studies such as this need to be shouted from the rooftops. The wage gap between CEOs and US workers jumped last year to 670 to one, up from 604 to one in 2020. To put that in more tangible terms, CEOs at US companies with some of the lowest-paid staff made an average of $10.6m, while the median worker received just $23,968.  The pay disparity isn’t as stark in the UK, but it’s still bad. An analysis last year found that FTSE 350 chief executives were expected to collect 63 times the average median pay of workers at their companies, while 43 FTSE 350 bosses received more than 100 times their employees’ average salary in 2020.  How can you justify this enormous wage gap? You can’t. As studies such as this make clear, it’s not meritocracy that is driving the wage gap; it’s plain old greed.",

			"content": "A New York jury found on Tuesday that Donald Trump sexually abused the advice columnist E Jean Carroll in a New York department store changing room 27 years ago.  The verdict for the first time legally brands a former US president as a sexual predator. But as it is the result of a civil not criminal case, the only legal sanction Trump will face is financial.  In explaining a finding of sexual abuse to the jury, the judge said it had two elements. That Trump subjected Carroll to sexual contact without consent by use of force, and that it was for the purpose of sexual gratification.  The jury deliberated for less than three hours. It did not find Trump raped Carroll, but did find him liable for sexual abuse.  It awarded about $5m in compensatory and punitive damages: about $2m on the sexual abuse count and close to $3m for defamation, for branding her a liar.  Before the verdict in the highly charged case, the judge, Lewis A Kaplan, warned the courtroom: “No shouting. No jumping up and down. No race for the door.”  After the verdict, as she was escorted to a car, Carroll said: “We’re very happy.”  George Conway, a conservative lawyer and Trump critic who encouraged Carroll to sue, said on Twitter: “God bless E Jean Carroll and congratulations to Roberta Kaplan [Carroll’s attorney] and her team for a job well done.”  Trump used his Truth Social platform to say: “I have absolutely no idea who this woman is. The verdict is a disgrace – a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time.”  In his deposition, released to the public last week, Trump mistook a picture of Carroll in his company for a picture of his second wife, Marla Maples.  On Tuesday, lawyers for Trump issued a statement deriding the case as “bogus” and saying they would appeal “and … ultimately win”.  Politically, Trump has capitalised on his legal woes, leading by wide margins in polling regarding the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Nonetheless, he faces mounting legal danger.  In New York last month, Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 criminal charges of falsifying business records over a hush-money payment to the porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election.  Trump looks likely to face criminal charges over attempts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia, and is also the target of a federal investigation into his actions around the election, including his incitement of the US Capitol attack.  A federal special counsel is also investigating the stashing of secret documents at his Florida estate. In New York, Trump faces a civil suit over his business and tax affairs.  In the Carroll case, a jury of three women and six men was persuaded by Carroll’s testimony over three days, describing events in a New York department store changing room in 1996.  Trump’s lawyer, Joe Tacopina, said he would use Carroll’s own words to disprove her allegation, showing the former Elle magazine columnist conspired with friends to falsely accuse the former president because they “hated” Trump and his politics.  But in seven days of testimony, he failed to do either.  Carroll testified that the attack left her unable to have a romantic relationship. She said Trump “shattered my reputation” by denying the attack when she went public in 2019, after which Elle sacked her in months. Trump repeatedly called Carroll a liar, including after her first day of testimony when he claimed a “made up SCAM”.  Carroll told the trial she ran into Trump as she was leaving the Bergdorf Goodman department store one evening in spring 1996.  “He said, ‘I need to buy a gift, come help me,’” she said. “I was delighted.”  Carroll said she suggested a handbag or a hat but he wasn’t interested.  “He said, ‘I know, lingerie,’” she said. “He led the way to the escalator.”  Carroll described herself as “absolutely enchanted” and “delighted” to go to the lingerie department. She told the court Trump “snatched up” a bodysuit and told her to try it on.  “I had no intention of putting it on. I said, ‘You put it on, it’s your colour’,” she said.  Carroll said Trump suggested they both try it on, and motioned toward the dressing room. She said she thought it was all a joke. The mood changed rapidly.  “He immediately shut the door and shoved me up against the wall. He shoved me so hard my head banged. I was extremely confused,” she said.  “He leaned down and pulled down my tights,” she said. “I was pushing him back. It was quite clear I didn’t want anything else to happen.”  Speaking quietly and slowly, she said Trump raped her.  Carroll said she will always regret going into the dressing room with Trump. She shed tears as she explained that since the rape she found it impossible to even smile at a man she was attracted to, and that it marked the end of her sex life.  Two of Carroll’s friends told the trial she confided in them immediately after the attack but swore them to secrecy.  Tacopina challenged Carroll during nearly two days of cross-examination. The lawyer focused on her actions during and immediately after the attack, questioning why she didn’t scream or call the police, and why she waited more than 20 years to publicly accuse Trump.  But the questioning backfired as Carroll gave confident and credible explanations, saying her inability to give a single cause for not screaming was not evidence she was lying.  “One of the reasons women don’t come forward is because they’re always asked, ‘Why didn’t you scream?’ Some women scream. Some women don’t. It keeps women silent,” she said.  Carroll said she was too “ashamed” to go to the police, even if that was the advice she gave in her Elle column.  “I was born in 1943. I’m a member of the silent generation. Women like me were taught to keep our chins up and to not complain. I would never call the police about something I am ashamed of.”  “I was never going to talk about what Donald Trump did,” she said.  But she was motivated to speak as the #MeToo movement took off and women across the US related experiences of sexual assault and harassment.  Carroll also sued Trump for defamation, having expected him to say they had a consensual encounter, not deny it altogether.  “It hit me and it laid me low because I lost my reputation. Nobody looked at me the same. It was gone. Even people who knew me looked at me with pity in their eyes, and the people who had no opinion now thought I was a liar and hated me,” she said.  Carroll said she considers Trump “evil” and a “terrible” president but denied bringing the lawsuit because of her political views.  “I’m not settling a political score. I’m settling a personal score,” she said.  Asked if she regretted accusing Trump, given the consequences, her voice broke.  “I regretted this about 100 times but, in the end, being able to get my day in court finally is everything,” she said, through tears.",

In the latest example of the prime minister’s fondness for short-distance air travel, the prime minister visited Southampton to set out plans for pharmacists to provide prescriptions for millions of patients in England to help ease the GP crisis.  However, instead of getting the train from Waterloo station for the 160-mile round trip, which would have taken one hour 15 minutes and cost about £30 return, he opted to travel by air, at a cost to the taxpayer in the region of £6,000.  The visit, instead of reassuring Tory MPs that he was focused on getting on with the job after the Conservatives lost more than 950 seats in last week’s local elections, unintentionally underlined the fears of some that he is seen by voters as out of touch.  “Is it unfair to say that the weekend was about a powerful unelected individual who is unfeasibly wealthy and lacks the common touch … and King Charles III?” one Tory MP even joked darkly.  “To go backwards from our results in 2019 when we lost 1,300 seats is a damning indictment of the public view of the government. To outperform our own very low expectations is appalling.”  Sunak told reporters in Southampton that the local elections results were “obviously disappointing” but insisted his priorities were right for the country and he would “keep working” to deliver them.  His official spokesperson claimed that he had travelled by helicopter in part because he had “a series of meetings” in the afternoon that he needed to attend, with No 10 insiders insisting he was determined to stick with his plan.  Yet when his MPs returned to Westminster after the coronation weekend many were despondent. One former cabinet minister told the Guardian that Sunak’s allies were in “fantasy land” if they thought his plan could bring about the Tories returning to power next year.  “I think we can still deny Labour a majority, but I can’t see a path to us actually winning the election. Rishi has clearly decided his best bet is to stick to the path that he’s on, but I don’t think that will be enough.”  There are also concerns that voters do not see Sunak’s priorities as the right ones for the country – or at least don’t believe they’re deliverable. “If his five pledges were really the people’s priorities then they would presumably have voted for them,” one MP said.  Others have criticised party’s local election campaign, with Justin Tomlinson, the North Swindon MP, saying the Conservatives had gone into the local election lacking “a coherent message” and did not even hold a proper launch event.  “The results were devastating,” he told Times Radio. “It’s frankly insane for anybody to try and spin it otherwise … This was off the scale. We lost some very good councillors, not just in Swindon but in many parts of the country. It has to be a wake up call for the party at all levels. There’s no getting away from that.”  One former minister told the Guardian that beyond the sheer scale of losses last Thursday, the way it happened pointed towards more fundamental worries for the Conservatives.  “Obviously, a lot of it was because of where we are politically, but one thing I really noticed in my area this time is that we just don’t have the ground operation any more.  “There is a real lack of volunteers, and this is a long-term problem. We’re an ageing party. We’re a shrinking party. And every time we lose 1,000 councillors the problem gets worse. It’s going to be a real issue in the general election.”  However, one backbench MP insisted that despite the opposition gains, there was still a route for Sunak to lead the biggest party after a general election.  “Yes, some of the results were pretty grim, but voters like to give the government a kicking in local elections,” they said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean they will do the same in a general election.  “Rishi has really stabilised things since Boris and Liz, and in my area people are gradually starting to notice. We’re certainly in a much better place. There was a time when Liz was PM that I worried our election loss would be so bad there was an outside chance I’d end up as opposition leader.”  Downing Street will, no doubt, take some solace from the lack of appetite from MPs for yet another Tory leadership contest – or bringing back Boris Johnson. One MP admits: “Colleagues have run out of puff, but they’re not feeling rebellious. Though I think that’s probably the worst of all worlds for the party.”",

			"content": "After almost 30 years of gardening, several of those at fine institutions such as the Royal Horticultural Society and Kew Gardens, I’ve realised that much of what I was taught is, if not wrong, not exactly on the mark either. All that laboured effort – the weeding, the fertilising, the digging, the tending and pruning, the selecting and conforming – it’s not working. Not for the plants, the soil or the community around them, which includes you and me. Indigenous cultures everywhere have based their practices on observing and honouring the ecology, while we in the “developed world” wrote down our rules. Our attempt to control nature has perpetuated poor relations with all the beings in the garden, turning everything into some sort of battle, or endless regimes whether that’s mowing, hoeing, watering or attacking some critter. It is a lot of work and these days way more than I am prepared to put in. Now spring is finally unfurling, this growing season, perhaps rather than going to work in our gardens, we could all relax a little, spend more time looking and listening, waiting rather than reacting, being in the garden as much as actively gardening. Here is how it’s done.  If you are even faintly interested in gardening you will have heard of “no dig”, in which you eschew your spade and take up a hoe instead. Rather than turning the soil, a structure that has been hundreds of millions of years in the making and thus has thought long and hard about which way up it should be, you lightly hoe or “tickle” the soil to remove any unwanted weeds and leave its multitudes of microbes, fungi and insects intact, exactly where they want to be. Happy microbes make for happy plant roots, better able to take up nutrients, fight off pests and diseases and withstand drought. As you keep doing it, there will be fewer weeds to remove.  Every soil has its weed seed bank: the adage goes one year’s seed is seven years of weed, but actually it’s more like decades for several of them. They are there not to annoy you, but to act as a lifejacket to the soil. Exposed, weed-free soil is very easily damaged or eroded by the weather: the sun bakes it, the wind harries, the rain pelts it, either compacting it or if a deluge comes, causing run-off. Again, those several million years of evolution weren’t a system sitting still, but advancing to a point of self-resilience. The vast majority of weed seeds need light to germinate. The more you disturb the soil, forking it over, digging things up, the more light you let in and the more the soil has to rush to protect itself. It flushes its weed-seed bank as a protective coat to hold the system together.  Talking of weeds, it’s time we ditched the word altogether. Even the Chelsea flower show is rebranding weeds as “hero plants”. Perhaps we can talk of them as common folk or elders (they’ve been around a lot longer than us), because every weed in your garden is trying to tell you something very important.  The more one type dominates, the louder the sermon is. Dandelions are saying your soil is a little compact, low on surface nutrients, particularly calcium and potassium; nettles tell you there is too much surface nitrogen (not as good as it sounds). A flurry of annual weeds – bittercress, chickweed and mouse weeds – say your soil is dominated by bacteria, while thistles, docks, green alkanets and comfrey are another sign that the surface is a little low on nutrients and only those with long tap roots to mine the sub-soil layer can thrive. Brambles tend to proliferate where there is excessive nitrogen, but the land has been left alone so they can take better hold. There is some evidence, though, that they have a potential role in the natural regeneration of tree seedlings: deer won’t browse in the middle of a bramble thicket and in a woodland this means the tree seedlings won’t get nibbled, while the mycorrhizal fungi will tap into the woodland network to boost the seedlings with enough growth to make it up and out of the thicket.  Once you start looking into the ecology of anything that we flippantly call a weed, you will discover that it is key in recycling nutrients, providing food in the form of nectar and pollen for all manner of insects, in all manner of weather. And not just for pollinators, but also for things such as leaf miners that turn into micro-moths, and flies that turn into food for hungry mouths reaching out of the nest, which turn into food for raptors flying high above. “I know,” I hear you cry. Of course you do, but I bet you still go out weeding when you don’t have to.  Many of these common folk arrive to help the soil out. If you ease back on the weeding (you will still have to intervene sometimes), and instead pay attention to the soil, many of the common folk will quite quickly become occasional folk instead. Annual ones are a sign that the soil has become bacterially dominated, having evolved from alluvial flood plains to meadows to fields, and thriving in the company of bacteria. They do not thrive in the fungally dominated soils of woodlands. Fungi thrive in soil rich in carbon because that is what they eat.  If you have too many annual weeds, add more carbon to your soil in the form of bulky homemade compost, cardboard (could be shredded, could be laid down as a sheet, could be added to your home composting), or brown leaves (you don’t even have to make leaf mould). You don’t have to dig it in – the worms will incorporate it all into the soil. That is, if you gave up your spade because one of the biggest threats to earthworms is our habit of ploughing and digging, partly because if you are chopped in half, you don’t regrow, and because worm tunnels have their own beautiful architecture that supports the soil, but not if they have collapsed.  So, we have thrown away the spade, considerably loosened up on weeding; now it is time to relinquish tidying up. We all do it, remove a yellowing or nibbled leaf, sweep up the spent leaves and pick up sticks, prune out the dead and dying. In part because the idea was that all this material would harbour slugs, other pests and diseases. It might, but one soul’s pest is another’s supper. It is true slugs rather love a pile of damp, slightly rotting leaves, but so do the beetles that hunt them.  This story is played out over and over again: if one thing proliferates in a natural system something else, sometimes many things, will come to dine on this opportunity, to restore the balance. A garden allowed to find this balance doesn’t have pest or disease problems – it has beings, who are living and dying, sometimes thriving, but rarely at the cost of the whole system. This balancing act takes time, several years or more, but I promise you this: even the slugs settle down. Rotting, disease, pests are just the Earth’s recycling system. It is not a great leap of faith to trust time. Plants have been around far longer than we have been gardening, with plenty of time to work on the nuances of reciprocity.  Ever since the second world war we have been falsely worshipping nitrogen and phosphorus as kings in the fertiliser game. Synthetic fertilisers, a very bad hangover from bomb manufacturing, led us to believe we could rig the system. Using them meant farmers could turn every bit of soil into a field, for a while at least, and it trickled down into how we gardened.  There is a much wider debate about excessive fertiliser use, in particular nitrogen, in farming, but that’s largely out of our hands. The garden isn’t.  There is no need for manufactured chemicals of any kind here. First, all soils differ but synthetic fertilisers, particularly the kind sold to gardeners, take a one-size-fits-all approach. Regardless of where you are, you apply the same amount of plant food. These synthetic fertilisers don’t stay in situ; they run off. And there is evidence that over time, they can deplete soils of stored carbon, reducing fertility, even if organic matter is still added. In short, if you buy fertilisers you are paying for short-term gains. Homemade compost is free and it will build your soil, helping store carbon and feeding your plants. Even if you make it really badly.  If you want an even more carefree approach, you can do most of your composting without heaving stuff around. Don’t clear away your spent crops, leave the pumpkin stems and leaves, take down the old tomato and bean plants and let everything lie on the soil. You can cover it to speed things up – market gardeners tend to use black plastic for convenience, but cardboard is plentiful, free and easy enough for a small garden. Covered or not, this allows the crop residues to go straight back to where they came from. If you want to plant straight back into the space you just harvested or cleared, try mowing, strimming, shredding or chopping up by hand the spent crops and planting straight into that. It’s quicker, avoids hauling stuff to the compost heap and back and again and makes for wonderful, friable soil. That whole notion about hoeing and raking the soil to make a fine tilth to grow in? Turns out it’s better done by the soil system than your sweat.  I’m not suggesting we should give up compost. It is still the best way to deal with household organic matter, be that food waste, paper and cardboard, pet hair, etc. You just don’t need to bring in extra compost or manures especially for your soil, when in- and on-ground methods might get you to a richer soil with less effort and less cost. And if you do bring in compost, never, ever use peat. It is destroying precious peatland habitats that we need for carbon storage, clean water and flood management. Those that live on peat bogs don’t want to live anywhere else, so let us not destroy their home for the idiocies of gardening.  Finally, let us embrace the diverse, the slightly different, the variable in our flowers and foods. For millennia, we have been selecting and breeding plants so that they benefit us – this is our origin story. But for the longest time this was a laid-back process of letting the pollinators go to work, saving seed, growing on and noticing what worked best for the conditions where you were. It is known, technically, as creating a landrace, an ancient cultivar that is variable, often containing many alleles (forms of genes) that are not present in modern highly bred cultivars. Landrace gardening is the opposite: akin to a plant orgy, you let all your carrot varieties, or whatever it is you are growing, cross-pollinate with each other to create a diverse breeding population. It is a survival strategy that diversifies the gene pool, making it better future-proofed than something highly bred.  The result is a beetroot or a bean or flower that is not uniform; as the different alleles play out their expression, so a landrace varies in colour, size, texture and even flavour. Anyone can become a landrace gardener. It’s a fun, five-year-plus experiment that takes very little effort and will reward you with vegetables and flowers that work entirely for your system of growing and your soil. Don’t want to spend all summer watering excessively (can I remind you how hot last summer was)? Breed a leafy green that doesn’t need it. Got poor soil? Breed a potato that loves it. Want a tomato that tastes of something but doesn’t mind a late frost? It’s all possible.  Sow all the named varieties that have the characteristics you want, grow them and, with the help of bees promote promiscuity and let them cross-pollinate. Select and save seed from only the ones that do well in your soil. Start again next spring, sowing your saved seed. Up to half of it might not survive, but you’ll have oodles of seed, so it doesn’t matter. Let the pollinators at the new plants, select seeds from the ones that are working and keep going. In a couple of seasons, you can have garlic that is entirely adapted to your soil – it might take a few more years to find that perfect pumpkin or tomato.  We don’t know where we are heading as far as our future on this planet is concerned, but we might as well go there prepared with a wide gene pool, in relation with our common folk plants and their communities, in awe of our insects, fascinated by our fungal friends, with our soils and our energy replenished. And like any friendship group, that is best done by hanging out, kicking back and enjoying each other’s company.  In all of this I am not advocating giving up on gardening, but shifting the perspective on what needs doing. If the dandelion, dock or bramble isn’t in the way, leave it. If the plant goes down in an orgy of aphids, leave it for some other garden being to clear up. Let plants die in place, learn to watch and observe before you make a move. You’ll see that nature is way more willing to help than cause trouble.",

It flushes its weed-seed bank as a protective coat to hold the system together.</p><p><span></span></p><h2 id=\"ease-off-weeding\">Ease off weeding</h2><p></p><figure data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" id=\"628b2687-ab84-44b3-bd15-2d9d43fd009f\"><div><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d08767bf29b931876514d53b5aa13167fe0da7e/0_533_7997_4801/master/7997.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 660px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d08767bf29b931876514d53b5aa13167fe0da7e/0_533_7997_4801/master/7997.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d08767bf29b931876514d53b5aa13167fe0da7e/0_533_7997_4801/master/7997.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d08767bf29b931876514d53b5aa13167fe0da7e/0_533_7997_4801/master/7997.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d08767bf29b931876514d53b5aa13167fe0da7e/0_533_7997_4801/master/7997.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d08767bf29b931876514d53b5aa13167fe0da7e/0_533_7997_4801/master/7997.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"267.1558084281605\" width=\"445\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d08767bf29b931876514d53b5aa13167fe0da7e/0_533_7997_4801/master/7997.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\" alt=\"‘Every weed in your garden is trying to tell you something very important.’\"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\" height=\"13\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>‘Every weed in your garden is trying to tell you something very important.’</span> Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Talking of weeds, it’s time we ditched the word altogether. Even the <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/25/chelsea-flower-show-gardens-rebrand-weeds-hero-plants\">Chelsea flower show is rebranding</a> weeds as “hero plants”. Perhaps we can talk of them as common folk or elders (they’ve been around a lot longer than us), because every weed in your garden is trying to tell you something very important.</p><p>The more one type dominates, the louder the sermon is. Dandelions are saying your soil is a little compact, low on surface nutrients, particularly calcium and potassium; nettles tell you there is too much surface nitrogen (not as good as it sounds). A flurry of annual weeds – bittercress, chickweed and mouse weeds – say your soil is dominated by bacteria, while thistles, docks, green alkanets and comfrey are another sign that the surface is a little low on nutrients and only those with long tap roots to mine the sub-soil layer can thrive. Brambles tend to proliferate where there is excessive nitrogen, but the land has been left alone so they can take better hold. There is some evidence, though, that they have a potential role in the natural regeneration of tree seedlings: deer won’t browse in the middle of a bramble thicket and in a woodland this means the tree seedlings won’t get nibbled, while the mycorrhizal fungi will tap into the woodland network to boost the seedlings with enough growth to make it up and out of the thicket.</p><p>Once you start looking into the ecology of anything that we flippantly call a weed, you will discover that it is key in recycling nutrients, providing food in the form of nectar and pollen for all manner of insects, in all manner of weather. And not just for pollinators, but also for things such as leaf miners that turn into micro-moths, and flies that turn into food for hungry mouths reaching out of the nest, which turn into food for raptors flying high above. “I know,” I hear you cry. Of course you do, but I bet you still go out weeding when you don’t have to.</p><p>Many of these common folk arrive to help the soil out. If you ease back on the weeding (you will still have to intervene sometimes), and instead pay attention to the soil, many of the common folk will quite quickly become occasional folk instead. Annual ones are a sign that the soil has become bacterially dominated, having evolved from alluvial flood plains to meadows to fields, and thriving in the company of bacteria. They do not thrive in the fungally dominated soils of woodlands. Fungi thrive in soil rich in carbon because that is what they eat.</p><p>If you have too many annual weeds, add more carbon to your soil in the form of bulky homemade compost, cardboard (could be shredded, could be laid down as a sheet, could be added to your home composting), or brown leaves (you don’t even have to make leaf mould). You don’t have to dig it in – the worms will incorporate it all into the soil. That is, if you gave up your spade because one of the biggest threats to earthworms is our habit of ploughing and digging, partly because if you are chopped in half, you don’t regrow, and because worm tunnels have their own beautiful architecture that supports the soil, but not if they have collapsed.</p><p><span></span></p><h2 id=\"embrace-rot-and-death\">Embrace rot and death</h2><p></p><figure data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" data-spacefinder-role=\"showcase\" id=\"d5d3cfdf-79ab-4339-bb7b-9d9c802c132c\"><div><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1300px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1140px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 980px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 660px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"267.152099609375\" width=\"445\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f423d46446022d2cda3dc558caa26a645c671d9/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\" alt=\"‘If one thing proliferates in a natural system something else will come to dine on this opportunity.’\"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\" height=\"13\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>‘If one thing proliferates in a natural system something else will come to dine on this opportunity.’</span> Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>So, we have thrown away the spade, considerably loosened up on weeding; now it is time to relinquish tidying up. We all do it, remove a yellowing or nibbled leaf, sweep up the spent leaves and pick up sticks, prune out the dead and dying. In part because the idea was that all this material would harbour slugs, other pests and diseases. It might, but one soul’s pest is another’s supper. It is true slugs rather love a pile of damp, slightly rotting leaves, but so do the beetles that hunt them.</p><p>This story is played out over and over again: if one thing proliferates in a natural system something else, sometimes many things, will come to dine on this opportunity, to restore the balance. A garden allowed to find this balance doesn’t have pest or disease problems – it has beings, who are living and dying, sometimes thriving, but rarely at the cost of the whole system. This balancing act takes time, several years or more, but I promise you this: even the slugs settle down. Rotting, disease, pests are just the Earth’s recycling system. It is not a great leap of faith to trust time. Plants have been around far longer than we have been gardening, with plenty of time to work on the nuances of reciprocity.</p><p><span></span></p><h2 id=\"stop-chasing-fast-growth\">Stop chasing fast growth</h2><p></p><p>Ever since the second world war we have been falsely worshipping nitrogen and phosphorus as kings in the fertiliser game. Synthetic fertilisers, a very bad hangover from bomb manufacturing, led us to believe we could rig the system. Using them meant farmers could turn every bit of soil into a field, for a while at least, and it trickled down into how we gardened.</p><p>There is a much wider debate about <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/causes-campaigns/fixing-nitrogen-the-challenge-for-climate-nature-and-health/\">excessive fertiliser</a> use, in particular nitrogen, in farming, but that’s largely out of our hands. The garden isn’t.</p><p>There is no need for manufactured chemicals of any kind here. First, all soils differ but synthetic fertilisers, particularly the kind sold to gardeners, take a one-size-fits-all approach. Regardless of where you are, you apply the same amount of plant food. These synthetic fertilisers don’t stay in situ; they run off. And there is evidence that over time, they can <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://grist.org/article/2010-02-23-new-research-synthetic-nitrogen-destroys-soil-carbon-undermines/\">deplete soils of stored carbon</a>, reducing fertility, even if organic matter is still added. In short, if you buy fertilisers you are paying for short-term gains. Homemade compost is free and it will build your soil, helping store carbon and feeding your plants. Even if you make it really badly.</p><p><span></span></p><h2 id=\"compost-in-situ\">Compost in situ</h2><p></p><figure data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" id=\"cae4587c-0140-4113-859f-8a478af9b0ec\"><div><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59867557b685594b9ab873170ef8abbbbf01145/0_219_8192_5245/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 660px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59867557b685594b9ab873170ef8abbbbf01145/0_219_8192_5245/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59867557b685594b9ab873170ef8abbbbf01145/0_219_8192_5245/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59867557b685594b9ab873170ef8abbbbf01145/0_219_8192_5245/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59867557b685594b9ab873170ef8abbbbf01145/0_219_8192_5245/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59867557b685594b9ab873170ef8abbbbf01145/0_219_8192_5245/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"284.9151611328125\" width=\"445\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59867557b685594b9ab873170ef8abbbbf01145/0_219_8192_5245/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\" alt=\"No more heavy lifting … let your soil do the hard work.\"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\" height=\"13\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>No more heavy lifting … let your soil do the hard work.</span> Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>If you want an even more carefree approach, you can do most of your composting without heaving stuff around. Don’t clear away your spent crops, leave the pumpkin stems and leaves, take down the old tomato and bean plants and let everything lie on the soil. You can cover it to speed things up – market gardeners tend to use black plastic for convenience, but cardboard is plentiful, free and easy enough for a small garden. Covered or not, this allows the crop residues to go straight back to where they came from. If you want to plant straight back into the space you just harvested or cleared, try mowing, strimming, shredding or chopping up by hand the spent crops and planting straight into that. It’s quicker, avoids hauling stuff to the compost heap and back and again and makes for wonderful, friable soil. That whole notion about hoeing and raking the soil to make a fine tilth to grow in? Turns out it’s better done by the soil system than your sweat.</p><p>I’m not suggesting we should give up compost. It is still the best way to deal with household organic matter, be that food waste, paper and cardboard, pet hair, etc. You just don’t need to bring in extra compost or manures especially for your soil, when in- and on-ground methods might get you to a richer soil with less effort and less cost. And if you do bring in compost, never, ever use peat. It is destroying precious peatland habitats that we need for carbon storage, clean water and flood management. Those that live on peat bogs don’t want to live anywhere else, so let us not destroy their home for the idiocies of gardening.</p><p><span></span></p><h2 id=\"encourage-plant-promiscuity\">Encourage plant promiscuity</h2><p></p><p>Finally, let us embrace the diverse, the slightly different, the variable in our flowers and foods. For millennia, we have been selecting and breeding plants so that they benefit us – this is our origin story. But for the longest time this was a laid-back process of letting the pollinators go to work, saving seed, growing on and noticing what worked best for the conditions where you were. It is known, technically, as creating a landrace, an ancient cultivar that is variable, often containing many alleles (forms of genes) that are not present in modern highly bred cultivars. Landrace gardening is the opposite: akin to a plant orgy, you let all your carrot varieties, or whatever it is you are growing, cross-pollinate with each other to create a diverse breeding population. It is a survival strategy that diversifies the gene pool, making it better future-proofed than something highly bred.</p><figure data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" data-spacefinder-role=\"showcase\" id=\"97967bf5-51cf-476f-b24e-eb076a6f0537\"><div><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1300px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1140px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 980px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 660px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"278.3966064453125\" width=\"445\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0497c14344c37abdb80a7f7ac2fa31d2bb634df5/0_339_8192_5125/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\" alt=\"‘We don’t know where we are heading but we might as well go there prepared with a wide gene pool.’\"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\" height=\"13\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>‘We don’t know where we are heading but we might as well go there prepared with a wide gene pool.’</span> Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The result is a beetroot or a bean or flower that is not uniform; as the different alleles play out their expression, so a landrace varies in colour, size, texture and even flavour. Anyone can become a <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG7DSSI_DlHlkD4JRhGxRWA\">landrace gardener</a>. It’s a fun, five-year-plus experiment that takes very little effort and will reward you with vegetables and flowers that work entirely for your system of growing and your soil. Don’t want to spend all summer watering excessively (can I remind you how hot last summer was)? Breed a leafy green that doesn’t need it. Got poor soil? Breed a potato that loves it. Want a tomato that tastes of something but doesn’t mind a late frost? It’s all possible.</p><p>Sow all the named varieties that have the characteristics you want, grow them and, with the help of bees promote promiscuity and let them cross-pollinate. Select and save seed<strong> </strong>from only the ones that do well in your soil. Start again next spring, sowing your saved seed. Up to half of it might not survive, but you’ll have oodles of seed, so it doesn’t matter. Let the pollinators at the new plants, select seeds from the ones that are working and keep going. In a couple of seasons, you can have garlic that is entirely adapted to your soil – it might take a few more years to find that perfect pumpkin or tomato.</p><p>We don’t know where we are heading as far as our future on this planet is concerned, but we might as well go there prepared with a wide gene pool, in relation with our common folk plants and their communities, in awe of our insects, fascinated by our fungal friends, with our soils and our energy replenished. And like any friendship group, that is best done by hanging out, kicking back and enjoying each other’s company.</p><p>In all of this I am not advocating giving up on gardening, but shifting the perspective on what needs doing. If the dandelion, dock or bramble isn’t in the way, leave it. If the plant goes down in an orgy of aphids, leave it for some other garden being to clear up. Let plants die in place, learn to watch and observe before you make a move. You’ll see that nature is way more willing to help than cause trouble.</p></div></div>"

			"content": "The eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, some 30km from the Russian border, has suffered grievously in the past year. Cruise missiles and shells rained down on it brutally last spring, killing hundreds of civilians, blasting the imposing regional government building and the opera house, cratering apartment blocks, shops, schools, churches and university buildings.  Having withstood the Russian assault, the city is now in a state of tentative recovery, despite the occasional artillery hit. Though many buildings are boarded up or ruined, shops and cafes are opening up in pockets. On a recent spring day, teams of volunteers were out tending streetside flowerbeds and sweeping the public squares.  In the early days of February 2022, artist Mykola Kolomiets had no idea of the momentous and deadly events that were coming his way. Instead, he was preparing for an exhibition. The show was planned to celebrate a decade of Aza Nizi Maza, the children’s art workshops he’d been running in his studio in the centre of the city.  “No one believed that the war was going to start,” says Kolomiets, sporting an orange woolly hat and an infectious grin, “even though we were warned by the experts. My girlfriend joked that the studio would make the perfect bomb shelter.”  You can see why: the studio is a labyrinthine, subterranean series of interconnected rooms. What it lacks in natural light – I spot a single window, taped up against the possibility of shattering glass – it makes up for in colour. Every surface is bright with the traces of old paint, and walls are thickly papered with artworks tacked to sheets of chipboard. A large table in the main room is heaped with children’s drawings and illustrated books for them to delve into for inspiration – everything from volumes of botanical illustrations to works on Picasso and Egyptian antiquities.  The quip about the air-raid shelter, though, turned out to be not so much of a joke when they looked at the map of safe refuges the city authorities circulated: the studio was marked on it. “It was a bit of a mess, so we started to clean it up, ready to receive people,” Kolomiets says.  They also prepared to sleep there themselves. Kolomiets even evacuated his aquarium and its piscine inhabitants – who are still in residence at the studio – from his 1920s apartment block a couple of kilometres away. Just as well: the block, the Slovo Building, originally designed to house Kharkiv’s writers, intellectuals and journalists, who were later brutally purged by Stalin, took a partial hit in the shelling (it is, thankfully, still standing).  Kolomiets and his girlfriend didn’t have to wait long for company. “As it turned out, all the other shelters nearby were in a terrible condition,” he says. People living and working nearby soon found their way to the studio – including the entire staff of a nearby Turkish restaurant. “They helped a lot to keep the place going, and they brought a lot of food.”  At the height of the shelling, in March and April, some 50 people were sleeping in the studio. The first civilian killed in the city died in their street. At one point in March a piece of shrapnel blasted through to the studio. Kolomiets holds out the twisted scrap of metal to show me: no one inside was hurt, but it’s a reminder of that terrifying period. The last among those sleeping there left in August.  In the meantime, Kolomiets decided that the art classes he’d been holding for kids could not stop. He decided, with an artist colleague, to go to the nearby Historical Museum underground station, where hundreds of Kharkivians slept during the worst of the bombardment – an experience vividly brought to life in the song Metro by Serhiy Zhadan, the poet, novelist and frontman of the ska band Zhadan and the Dogs.  One part of the grandiose, lofty halls of the Soviet-era station was reserved for sleeping quarters. The other was kept free for activities – breakdancing, for example, to try to give the subterranean inhabitants a bit of exercise – as well as some maths, literature and science taught by a woman the children called “Maria Biscuit”, owing to her doubtless sensible notion of resorting to bribery to entice the kids to learn.  It was here that Kolomiets set to work with around 15 children. “We joked that I’d always been dreaming of having a really big studio,” he says. “And here it was.” For 40 consecutive days from March to May, he ran art classes in the underground.  Kolomiets explains how he worked: he’d start to draw a figure, and ask the children what they thought it might be. One might be a soldier, they’d say, one a volunteer – and they’d work from there. One little boy, Oleksii, spent days drawing and colouring in the tiny pixellated squares that went to form the soldier’s camouflage jacket. “It was good to do this repetitious work, switching off your brain, concentrating on patterns,” Kolomiets says.  Sometimes he’d leave drawing materials out for the children overnight, and come back in the morning to find something new under way – a picture of a bee, or of an eye, say – and they’d work out how to incorporate the fresh drawings into the large works on paper that were taking shape.  “The children were always waiting for us,” he says. “They’d come right up to the top of the escalator in the morning.” Not just the children, he adds – adults, too, and the station workers would make sure as many lights as possible were switched on to allow them to work.  The drawings, Kolomiets tells me, are still there, by order of the mayor of Kharkiv – so I head to the underground station. There they are, attached to the great pillars that run the length of the platform, commuters milling about between them. I spot the picture of the soldier whose uniform Oleksii lovingly coloured, with flowers bursting from his automatic rifle and cats pawing at the leg of his fatigues.  I can only imagine the painting of a giant bird, bright with exotic plumage, acted as a reminder of the peaceful, lovely world above that had been shattered by the invasion. Elsewhere I spot the bee and the eye that Kolomiets told me about – they have found their way into an image of a hive that is also a house and, perhaps, a memory of home. A small expectant dog, its ears cocked, is positioned outside.  Back at the studio, Kolomiets proudly shows me some of the work that the young people have been making since the underground emptied of its inhabitants and he resumed regular teaching. Some of them are developing clear individual styles. Anna, who is 14, is currently drawing the destroyed buildings of Kharkiv, with oversize human figures inside.  Khrystyna, also 14, is interested in transforming AI-produced images. Vanya, five, is making portraits massively scaled up. The point is, says Kolomiets, that “we are all unique – and we help you develop that uniqueness. It turns out that Vanya, for example, really blossoms when he has huge scale to play with.”  I wonder about Kolomiets’ own practice as an artist. “I was working on a single painting between 2012 and 2014,” he tells me, “and then the war started.” He is referring to Russia’s illegal incursions into the Crimea and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, almost a decade ago. When I ask him about that work, he replies: “It was a figure of violence.” When he’d finished it, he says: “I felt I’d accomplished what I wanted to achieve.” He hasn’t made a painting of his own since.  I must look concerned, because he reassures me. Teaching his workshops “is eternal happiness for me”, he says. “I truly experience joy in this.” Even – perhaps especially – when the Russian cruise missiles and artillery rounds pounded down.",

People living and working nearby soon found their way to the studio – including the entire staff of a nearby Turkish restaurant. “They helped a lot to keep the place going, and they brought a lot of food.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" data-spacefinder-role=\"showcase\" id=\"fec35351-71bc-4743-bfe5-65355c670c57\"><div><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1300px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1140px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 980px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 660px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"296.830812738227\" width=\"445\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2532c448adb37dde03926f2316f3996bb879037a/0_0_8133_5425/master/8133.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\" alt=\"Blooms not bullets … mural showing a soldier with flowers bursting out of his rifle, coloured in by a young boy called Oleksii.\"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\" height=\"13\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Blooms not bullets … mural showing a soldier with flowers bursting out of his rifle, coloured in by a young boy called Oleksii.</span> Photograph: Ed Ram/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>At the height of the shelling, in March and April, some 50 people were sleeping in the studio. The first civilian killed in the city died in their street. At one point in March a piece of shrapnel blasted through to the studio. Kolomiets holds out the twisted scrap of metal to show me: no one inside was hurt, but it’s a reminder of that terrifying period. The last among those sleeping there left in August.</p><p>In the meantime, Kolomiets decided that the art classes he’d been holding for kids could not stop. He decided, with an artist colleague, to go to the nearby Historical Museum underground station, where hundreds of Kharkivians slept during the worst of the bombardment – an experience vividly brought to life in the song <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoVRE-wdoE0\">Metro</a> by Serhiy Zhadan, the poet, novelist and frontman of the ska band <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.hayfestival.com/p-20254-zhadan-and-the-dogs.aspx\">Zhadan and the Dogs</a>.</p><p>One part of the grandiose, lofty halls of the Soviet-era station was reserved for sleeping quarters. The other was kept free for activities – breakdancing, for example, to try to give the subterranean inhabitants a bit of exercise – as well as some maths, literature and science taught by a woman the children called “Maria Biscuit”, owing to her doubtless sensible notion of resorting to bribery to entice the kids to learn.</p><p>It was here that Kolomiets set to work with around 15 children. “We joked that I’d always been dreaming of having a really big studio,” he says. “And here it was.” For 40 consecutive days from March to May, he ran art classes in the underground.</p><figure data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" data-spacefinder-role=\"showcase\" id=\"58d67cb2-53c4-4e83-a5a1-f872d3ea5dc6\"><div><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1300px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1140px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 980px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 660px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 480px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none\"><source media=\"(min-width: 320px)\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\"><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"266.9670411060363\" width=\"445\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c08c0e7c30f26a1df4c07388a3073f97c4b4353/0_543_8101_4860/master/8101.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none\" alt=\"Underneath the arches … two of the children’s murals at the metro station for the Historical Museum, built during the Soviet era.\"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\" height=\"13\" width=\"18\"><path d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"></path></svg></span><span>Underneath the arches … two of the children’s murals at the metro station for the Historical Museum, built during the Soviet era.</span> Photograph: Ed Ram/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Kolomiets explains how he worked: he’d start to draw a figure, and ask the children what they thought it might be. One might be a soldier, they’d say, one a volunteer – and they’d work from there.

station. There they are, attached to the great pillars that run the length of the platform, commuters milling about between them. I spot the picture of the soldier whose uniform Oleksii lovingly coloured, with flowers bursting from his automatic rifle and cats pawing at the leg of his fatigues.</p><p>I can only imagine the painting of a giant bird, bright with exotic plumage, acted as a reminder of the peaceful, lovely world above that had been shattered by the invasion. Elsewhere I spot the bee and the eye that Kolomiets told me about – they have found their way into an image of a hive that is also a house and, perhaps, a memory of home.

(Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>There would also be health benefits to hibernation. Without the force of gravity, astronauts in space experience muscle wastage and bone density loss. Even at the&nbsp;International Space Station, where hi-tech gym equipment is available 24/7 and strict exercise protocols are followed, astronauts lose up <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/64249main_ffs_factsheets_hbp_atrophy.pdf\">to&nbsp;20% of their muscle mass.</a> Muscle wastage would be even more of a problem on missions to Mars, as there would be no support crews waiting by after a landing on the Red Planet.</p>\n<p>Hibernation could protect against some of these risks. Hibernating animals enter a special state called a torpor, whereby their metabolism slows and their heart rate, breathing and body temperature fall. Even the cells that make up the animal's body stop dividing and dying. Torpor, which is different to sleep, allows animals to preserve energy at times of food scarcity. However, it also seems to protect against some of the harmful effects of space travel. For instance, squirrels have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/11/1/54\">shown resistance to high levels of radiation while hibernating</a>, possibly because hibernating cells replicate at much lower rates and are therefore naturally less susceptible to radiation damage.</p></div><div><blockquote><h2>Bears are also a good model for human hibernation</h2></blockquote></div><div><p>Entering a torpor-like state also seems to help bears and squirrels preserve their <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/684619\">bone structure</a> and muscle tone. Despite hibernating for up to six months at a time, black bears emerge in spring with only marginal muscle loss, and are back to normal within 20 days. In fact, bears waking up from torpor show surprisingly high fitness levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"If you stayed in bed for several months you would lose a great deal of muscle tissue over that time,\" says Jüergen Bereiter-Hahn, a professor in neuroscience and cell biology at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. Bereiter-Hahn is a member of the Esa's hibernation research group, which conducts research into human hibernation for long distance spaceflight to Mars.</p>\n<p>\"This strong reduction of tissue during long periods of disuse is almost completely avoided during torpor, which means astronauts coming to Mars should be in good shape and shouldn't need a very long time to recover.\"</p></div><div id=\"future/article/20230509-will-we-everhibernate-in-space-p0fm98f4\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0fm98f4.webp\" media=\"(min-width:624px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0fm98f4.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:624px)\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0fm98f4.webp\" media=\"(min-width:485px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0fm98f4.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:485px)\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0fm98f4.webp\" media=\"(min-width:320px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0fm98f4.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:320px)\"><img id=\"\" alt=\"Astronauts currently keep to a similar day/night circle as those on Earth (Credit: Nasa)\" src=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0fm98f4.jpg\" title=\"Astronauts currently keep to a similar day/night circle as those on Earth (Credit: Nasa)\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div><p>Astronauts currently keep to a similar day/night circle as those on Earth (Credit: Nasa)</p></div></div><div><p>Bears are also a good model for human hibernation because they only lower their body temperature by a few degrees, but still manage to reduce their metabolic rate considerably. Hibernating bears can also still function relatively normally during hibernation, with some females known to even <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110817022136.htm\">wake up to give birth</a> during this time.</p>\n<p>But enough of the benefits. Is it possible? Well, maybe. Hibernating animals are distributed throughout the tree of life, including insects, amphibians, and many mammals. Studies have also shown that scientists can use drugs to induce <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0024320519300335?via%3Dihub\">a state of torpor in some animals such as rats</a> that don't usually hibernate. The drugs act on a region of the brain called the hypothalamus, which is involved in regulating the body's temperature and heartbeat.</p>\n<p>Cooling the body down could also initiate a kind of torpor-like state. In the 1990s, researchers from the Safar Center for Resuscitation Research at the University of Pittsburgh showed that rapidly cooling the circulatory system of <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.str.27.1.105\">dogs in cardiac arrest</a> sent them into a state of suspended animation.</p></div><div><blockquote><h2>There are a number of different approaches to how you could cool someone down and lower their metabolism – John Bradford</h2></blockquote></div><div><p>A similar process, known as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140505-secrets-behind-the-big-sleep\">therapeutic hypothermia</a>, is already used in some hospitals to treat patients in cardiac arrest or with traumatic brain injuries. It's thought that cooling the body down to around 32-34C (89.6-93.2F) reduces damage to the brain and other vital organs. This makes sense, as the cells in our body require a constant supply of oxygen to meet their metabolic demands. Under normal circumstances, the heart pumps this oxygen around our body. But in trauma patients, the loss of blood causes cells to run out of oxygen and quickly die. Cooling the body down by a few degrees reduces the body's demand for energy and oxygen, buying physicians important time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.spaceworks.aero/\">SpaceWorks Enterprises,</a> an aerospace engineering based in Atlanta, Georgia, believes that therapeutic hypothermia could also be a good way of placing space travellers into a \"synthetic torpor\". The firm has received funding from Nasa to flesh out its idea, which would see astronauts placed in compact pods where they would enter a two-week stint of extended hibernation, before being active for a couple of days, and then going back into stasis again. This could be done on rotation, so that there would always be a member of the crew awake, addressing safety concerns or any emergencies that might occur.</p></div><div id=\"future/article/20230509-will-we-everhibernate-in-space-p0fm99nb\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0fm99nb.webp\" media=\"(min-width:1200px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0fm99nb.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:1200px)\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0fm99nb.webp\" media=\"(min-width:880px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0fm99nb.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:880px)\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0fm99nb.webp\" media=\"(min-width:576px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0fm99nb.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:576px)\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0fm99nb.webp\" media=\"(min-width:224px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0fm99nb.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:224px)\"><img id=\"\" alt=\"Animals that hibernate, such as bears, go into a state called torpor which slows down their cellular activity and prevents muscle wastage (Credit: Getty Images)\" src=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0fm99nb.jpg\" title=\"Animals that hibernate, such as bears, go into a state called torpor which slows down their cellular activity and prevents muscle wastage (Credit: Getty Images)\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div><p>Animals that hibernate, such as bears, go into a state called torpor which slows down their cellular activity and prevents muscle wastage (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>\"There are a number of different approaches to how you could cool someone down and lower their metabolism,\" says John Bradford, SpaceWorks CEO.</p>\n<p>\"In clinical settings they use intravenous cold saline injections that cool your body down and put ice packs on you, but that would be too invasive and not very practical for a spaceflight.\"</p>\n<p>One option is to feed cooling nitrogen gas to astronauts via a nasal cannula. The gas would lower body temperature from 37.5C (99.5F) to around 32C (89.6F), which would cut metabolic activity by about 50%.</p>\n<p>\"We're also looking at other techniques such as using ambient air cooling to cool down the habitat, and then using a light sedative to relax the astronaut,\" says Bradford.</p>\n<p>Robotic arms in the SpaceWorks module could then be programmed to move astronaut limbs, check body sensors, and administer electrical stimuli to astronauts' muscles to maintain tone. The astronauts would also receive bags of nutrients containing essential electrolytes, dextrose, lipids, and vitamins.</p></div><div><blockquote><h2>As far as we know, there is nothing unique about homo sapiens that would prevent our species from hibernating - Vladyslav Vyazovskiy</h2></blockquote></div><div><p>However, if we're going to realise the dream of human hibernation, it's vital that we gain more of an understanding of how the body and brain would initiate the process in the first place.&nbsp; Much of the work so far has focused on a neurotransmitter called adenosine, which acts on pathways in the hypothalamus that control sleep. A <a href=\"https://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/30/10752\">study in 2011</a>&nbsp; found that Arctic ground squirrels given drugs that activated adenosine receptors spontaneously entered torpor, as long as they were given the drug in winter.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, other studies suggest that a part of the brainstem called the raphe pallidus, which helps control automatic bodily processes, may be involved. Matteo Cerri at the University of Bologna, Italy, and his colleagues found that they could get rats and pigs – which do not normally hibernate – to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763421002645\">enter a torpor-like state</a> by inhibiting this region.</p>\n\n<p>Summerer believes the mitochondria – a structure found in every living cell that converts chemicals in food into energy the body can use – may also play a role. His team is currently <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/mitochondria/\">conducting experiments</a> on the cells of hibernating Syrian hamsters to see if they have special adaptations that could help them cope with stressful environments.</p></div><div id=\"future/article/20230509-will-we-everhibernate-in-space-p0fm9bdk\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0fm9bdk.webp\" media=\"(min-width:1200px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0fm9bdk.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:1200px)\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0fm9bdk.webp\" media=\"(min-width:880px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0fm9bdk.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:880px)\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0fm9bdk.webp\" media=\"(min-width:576px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0fm9bdk.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:576px)\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0fm9bdk.webp\" media=\"(min-width:224px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0fm9bdk.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:224px)\"><img id=\"\" alt=\"Hamsters could hold the secret to preventing radiation damage to cells on long space voyages (Credit: Getty Images)\" src=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0fm9bdk.jpg\" title=\"Hamsters could hold the secret to preventing radiation damage to cells on long space voyages (Credit: Getty Images)\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div><p>Hamsters could hold the secret to preventing radiation damage to cells on long space voyages (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>To create a stressful environment, cells from the hamster are put into a centrifuge and spun at high speeds. This subjects the cells to very strong gravitational forces, up to 20 times that of Earth. The results are then compared with cells from humans to see if there is any difference. Preliminary results show that increased G-forces damage the mitochondria in both human and hamster cells, but that hamster cells are able to somehow remove the damaged mitochondria, while human cells are not. However, more work is needed to calculate how statistically significant these differences are.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the case, teasing out the mechanisms involved will help us know if hibernation could be possible in humans – and whether we retain these dormant brain-signalling pathways.</p>\n\n<p>\"As far as we know, there is nothing unique about <em>homo sapiens</em> that would prevent our species from hibernating, and I believe the capacity is there but it needs to be unlocked,\" says Vladyslav Vyazovskiy, professor of sleep physiology at the University of Oxford.</p>\n\n<p>\"To me the real question is not whether we can hibernate, but how… How do neurons in the hypothalamus 'know' that it is time to hibernate?

			"content": "A British national extradited to the US last month has pleaded guilty in New York to a role in one of the biggest hacks in social media history.  O'Connor, who was extradited from Spain, hijacked numerous Twitter accounts and sent out tweets asking followers to send Bitcoin to an account, promising to double their money.  O'Connor was charged alongside three other men over the scam. US teenager Graham Ivan Clark pleaded guilty in 2021. Nima Fazeli of Orlando, Florida, and Mason Sheppard, of Bognor Regis in the UK, were charged with federal crimes.  US Assistant Attorney-General Kenneth Polite Jr described in a statement O'Connor's actions as flagrant and malicious, saying he had harassed, threatened and extorted his victims, causing substantial emotional harm.  Like many criminal actors, O'Connor tried to stay anonymous by using a computer to hide behind stealth accounts and aliases from outside the United States.  But this plea shows that our investigators and prosecutors will identify, locate, and bring to justice such criminals to ensure they face the consequences for their crimes.  In 2020, an estimated 350 million Twitter users saw suspicious tweets from official accounts of the platform's biggest users. Thousands fell for a scam, trusting that a crypto giveaway was real.  Cyber experts agreed that the consequences of the Twitter hack could have been far worse if O'Connor and other hackers had more sophisticated plans than a get-rich-quick scheme.  Disinformation could have been spread to affect political discourse and markets could have been moved by well-worded fake business announcements, for example.  The hack showed how fragile Twitter's security was at the time. The attackers telephoned a small number of Twitter employees with a believable tale to convince them to hand over their internal login details - which eventually granted the hackers access to Twitter's powerful administrative tools.  Essentially, the hackers managed to use social engineering tricks more akin to those of conmen than of high-level cyber criminals to get access to the powerful internal control panel at the site.  O'Connor's admission has not come as a shock though as there was a wealth of evidence in the public domain thanks to the hackers making some bad mistakes or being too loud in their celebrations in the aftermath of the hack.",

			"content": "A New York jury has concluded that it is more likely than not that Donald Trump sexually abused and defamed E Jean Carroll. The verdict may be a harbinger of political and legal damage to come.  While the ruling may not make a dent in Mr Trump's base within the Republican Party, where his supporters view the US legal system with scepticism and have stood by him through all manners of adversity, it could have a lasting sting.  Central to Ms Carroll's lawsuit was the former president's deposition testimony, in which he seemed both demeaning and defensive. He explained away his infamous Access Hollywood tape boasts about grabbing women by their genitals as reflecting a historical truth about the power of celebrities - unfortunately or fortunately.  He said that both Ms Carroll and another woman who testified that Mr Trump sexually assaulted her were not his type - a description he also applied, voluntarily, to the female attorney conducting the deposition itself.  For a jury weighing whether Mr Trump was the kind of person capable of sexual assault - or, at least, whether he was more credible than his accuser - it was exactly the wrong attitude to present.  Up until now, the former president has run a fairly disciplined campaign to regain the White House in 2024. His team has methodically built up grass-roots support in key primary states across the country. His focused attacks on his rival Ron DeSantis appear to be drawing blood. He has managed to turn his New York indictment into a badge of honour among his base.  The sexual abuse and defamation ruling could give his Republican opponents an avenue for attack, however. If they can rattle him the way Ms Carroll's lawyer did, forcing him off message and into a defensive crouch, it could knock a candidate seemingly in control of his party into committing more unforced errors.  At the very least, it is another historic first for a former president who already faces one criminal indictment and has possibly others to come.  Up until now, Mr Trump has shrugged off such legal concerns. But the New York jury's decision lands a blow against Mr Trump in a way that mere investigations do not. A jury of everyday Americans have considered the evidence and found that Mr Trump did wrong.  None of it bodes well for those other legal headaches, including special counsel Jack Smith's inquiry into the former president's involvement in the attack on the US Capitol and his handling of classified documents after he left the White House, as well as Georgia's investigations of Mr Trump's attempt to reverse that state's 2020 presidential election results.  While it's unlikely in the extreme that Mr Trump would ever take the stand if those investigations turn into indictments - or will testify in the current New York indictment - prosecutors may look for ways to use the former president's statements or previous testimony against him as effectively as Ms Carroll's lawyer did.",

A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs estimated that AI capable of content generation could do a quarter of all the work currently done by humans.

The experts issue their warnings with a caveat: there are still things AI isn’t capable of – tasks that involve distinctly human qualities, like emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking. And moving into roles that centre those skills could help lessen the chances of being replaced.  “I think there are generally three categories that are going to be relatively insulated in the foreseeable future,” says Ford. “The first would be jobs that are genuinely creative: you’re not doing formulaic work or just rearranging things, but you're genuinely coming up with new ideas and building something new.”",

In fact, things like graphic design and visual art-related roles may be among the first to go; basic algorithms can direct a bot to analyse millions of images, allowing AI to master aesthetics instantly. But there’s some security in other kinds of creativity, says Ford: “in science, and medicine and law … people whose job is coming up with a new legal strategy or business strategy. I think that there's going to continue to be a place there for human beings”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second insulated category, he continues, is jobs that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships. He points to nurses, business consultants and investigative journalists. These are jobs, he says, “where you need a very deep understanding of people. I think it’ll be a long time before AI has the ability to interact in the kinds of ways that really build relationships”.</p>\n<p>The third safe zone, says Ford, “are jobs that really require lots of mobility and dexterity and problem-solving ability in unpredictable environments”. Many trade jobs – think electricians, plumbers, welders and the like – fall under this umbrella. “These are the kinds of jobs where you're dealing with a new situation all the time,” he adds. “They are probably the hardest of anything to automate. In order to automate jobs like this, you would need a science fiction robot. You’d need Star Wars’s C-3PO.”</p>\n<p>While humans will likely remain in jobs that fall within those categories, that doesn’t mean those professions are totally insulated from the ascent of AI. In fact, says Joanne Song McLaughlin, associate professor of labour economics at the University of Buffalo, US, most jobs, regardless of industry, have aspects that are likely to be automated by the technology.</p>\n<p>“In many cases, there’s no immediate threat to jobs,” she says, “but <em>tasks</em> will change.” Human jobs will become more focused on interpersonal skills, continues Song McLaughlin. “It’s easy to imagine that, for instance, AI will detect cancers way better than humans could. In the future, I’m assuming doctors will use that new technology. But I don’t think the doctor’s whole role will be replaced.”</p></div><div id=\"worklife/article/20230507-the-jobs-ai-wont-take-yet-p0flr3xr\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0flr3xr.webp\" media=\"(min-width:1200px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0flr3xr.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:1200px)\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0flr3xr.webp\" media=\"(min-width:880px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0flr3xr.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:880px)\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0flr3xr.webp\" media=\"(min-width:576px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0flr3xr.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:576px)\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0flr3xr.webp\" media=\"(min-width:224px)\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0flr3xr.jpg\" media=\"(min-width:224px)\"><img id=\"\" alt=\"Trade jobs and jobs that require a great deal of mobility are more likely to be insulated from automation (Credit: Getty Images)\" src=\"https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0flr3xr.jpg\" title=\"Trade jobs and jobs that require a great deal of mobility are more likely to be insulated from automation (Credit: Getty Images)\" draggable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div><p>Trade jobs and jobs that require a great deal of mobility are more likely to be insulated from automation (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>While a robot may ostensibly do a better job of finding cancer, she says, most people will still want a doctor – a real person – to be the one to tell them about it. That’s true of almost all jobs, she adds, and so developing those distinctly human skills could help people learn to do their jobs <em>alongside</em> AI.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s smart to really think, ‘what kind of tasks within my job will be replaced, or will be better done by computer or AI? And what's my complementary skill?’” She points to bank tellers, who once had to be very accurate money counters. Now, that task has been automated – but there’s still a place for the teller. &nbsp;“The task of money counting became obsolete because of a machine,” she says. “But now, the tellers are more focused on connecting with customers and introducing new products. The social skill has become more important.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It’s important to note, says Ford, that an advanced education or a high-paying position is not a defence against AI takeover. “We might think the person in the white-collar job is higher on the food chain than someone who drives a car for a living,” he says. “But the white-collar employee’s future is more threatened by the Uber driver, because we still don’t have self-driving cars, but AI can certainly write reports. In many cases, more educated workers are going to be more threatened than then even the least educated workers. Think of the person that works cleaning hotel rooms – it's really hard to automate that job.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In short, seeking roles in dynamic, shifting environments that include unpredictable tasks is good way to stave off job loss to AI. At least, for a while.</p></div></div></article></div></div>"

			"content": "I have not written much about the war in Ukraine lately because so little has changed strategically since the first few months of this conflict, when three overarching facts pretty much drove everything — and still do. Fact No. 1: As I wrote at the outset, when a war of this magnitude begins, the key question you ask yourself as a foreign affairs columnist is very simple: Where should I be? Should I be in Kyiv, the Donbas, Crimea, Moscow, Warsaw, Berlin, Brussels or Washington? And from the start of this war, there has been only one place to be to understand its timing and direction — and that’s in Vladimir Putin’s head. Unfortunately, Putin doesn’t grant visas to his brain. That’s a real problem because this war emerged entirely from there — with, we now know, almost no input from his cabinet or military commanders — and certainly with no mass urging from the Russian people. So Russia will be stopped in Ukraine, whether it’s winning or losing, only when Putin decides to stop.  Which leads to fact No. 2: Putin never had a Plan B. It’s now obvious that he thought he was going to waltz into Kyiv, seize it in a week, install a lackey as president, tuck Ukraine into his pocket and put to an end any further European Union, NATO or Western cultural expansion toward Russia. He would then cast his shadow across all of Europe. This leads to fact No. 3: Putin has put himself in a situation where he can’t win, can’t lose and can’t stop. There’s no way he can seize control of all of Ukraine anymore. But at the same time, he can’t afford to be defeated, after all the Russian lives and treasure he has expended. So he can’t stop. To put it differently, because Putin never had a Plan B, he’s defaulted to a punitive, often indiscriminate rocketing of Ukrainian towns and civilian infrastructure — a grinding war of attrition — with the hope that he can somehow drain enough blood from Ukrainians, and instill enough exhaustion in Kyiv’s Western allies, that they give him a big enough slice of Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine he can sell to the Russian people as a great victory. Putin’s Plan B is to disguise that Putin’s Plan A has failed. If this military operation had an honest name, it would be called Operation Save My Face. Which makes this one of the sickest, most senseless wars in modern times — a leader destroying another country’s civilian infrastructure until it gives him enough cover to hide the fact that he’s been a towering fool.  You can see from Putin’s Victory Day speech in Moscow on Tuesday that he is now grasping for any rationale to justify a war he started out of his personal fantasy that Ukraine is not a real country but part of Russia. He claimed his invasion was provoked by Western “globalists and elites” who “talk about their exclusivity, pit people and split society, provoke bloody conflicts and upheavals, sow hatred, Russophobia, aggressive nationalism and destroy traditional family values that make a person a person.” Wow. Putin invaded Ukraine to preserve Russian family values. Who knew? That’s a leader struggling to explain to his people why he started a war with a puny neighbor that he says is not a real country. You might ask, why does a dictator like Putin feel he needs a disguise? Can’t he make his people believe whatever he wants? I don’t think so. If you look at his behavior, it seems that Putin is quite frightened today by two subjects: arithmetic and Russian history. To understand why these subjects frighten him, you need to first consider the atmosphere enveloping him — something neatly captured, as it happens, in lyrics from the song “Everybody Talks” by one of my favorite rock groups, Neon Trees. The key refrain is: Hey, baby, won’t you look my way?  I can be your new addiction.  Hey, baby, what you got to say?  All you’re giving me is fiction.  I’m a sorry sucker, and this happens all the time.  I find out that everybody talks.  Everybody talks, everybody talks.  It started with a whisper. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned as a foreign affairs writer reporting from autocratic countries is that no matter how tightly controlled a place is, no matter how brutal and iron-fisted its dictator, EVERYBODY TALKS.  They know who is stealing, who is cheating, who is lying, who is having an affair with whom. It starts with a whisper and often stays there, but everybody talks. Putin clearly knows this, too. He knows that even if he gets a few more kilometers of eastern Ukraine and holds Crimea, the minute he stops this war, his people will all do the cruel arithmetic on his Plan B — starting with subtraction. The White House reported last week that an estimated 100,000 Russian fighters have been killed or wounded in Ukraine in just the past five months and roughly 200,000 killed or wounded since Putin started this war in February 2022. That is a big number of casualties — even in a big country — and you can see that Putin is worried that his people are talking about it, because, beyond criminalizing any form of dissent, in April he rushed through a new law cracking down on draft dodging. Now anyone who doesn’t show up will face restrictions on banking, selling property, even getting a driver’s license. Putin would not be going to such lengths if he was not fearful that, despite his best efforts, everyone was whispering about how badly the war is going and how to avoid serving there.  Read the recent essay in The Washington Post by Leon Aron, a historian of Putin’s Russia and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, about Putin’s visit in March to the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol. “Two days after the International Criminal Court charged Putin with war crimes and issued a warrant for his arrest,” Aron wrote, “the Russian president came to Mariupol for a few hours. He was filmed stopping by the ‘Nevsky microdistrict,’ inspecting a new apartment and listening for a few minutes to the effusively grateful occupants. As he was leaving, a barely audible voice is heard on the video, crying out from a distance: ‘Eto vsyo nepravda!’ — ‘It’s all lies!’” Aron told me that the Russian media later scrubbed “It’s all lies” from the audio, but the fact that it had been left in there may have been a subversive act by someone in the official Russian media hierarchy. Everybody talks. Which leads to the other thing Putin knows: “The gods of Russian history are extremely unforgiving of military defeat,” Aron said. In the modern era, “when a Russian leader ends a war in a clear defeat — or with no win — usually there is a change of regime. We saw that after the first Crimean War, after the Russo-Japanese war, after Russia’s setbacks in World War I, after Khrushchev’s retreat from Cuba in 1962 and after Brezhnev and company’s Afghanistan quagmire, which hastened Gorbachev’s perestroika-and-glasnost revolution. The Russian people, for all their renowned patience, will forgive a lot of things — but not military defeat.” It’s for these reasons that Aron, who just finished a book about Putin’s Russia, argues that this Ukraine conflict is far from over and could get a lot worse before it is.",

Should I be in Kyiv, the Donbas, Crimea, Moscow, Warsaw, Berlin, Brussels or Washington?</p><p>And from the start of this war, there has been only one place to be to understand its timing and direction — and that’s in Vladimir Putin’s head. Unfortunately, Putin doesn’t grant visas to his brain.</p><p>That’s a real problem because this war emerged entirely from there — with, <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/16/world/europe/russia-putin-war-failures-ukraine.html\">we now know</a>, almost no input from his cabinet or military commanders — and certainly with no mass urging from the Russian people. So Russia will be stopped in Ukraine, whether it’s winning or losing, only when Putin decides to stop.</p></div><div><p>Which leads to fact No. 2: Putin never had a Plan B. It’s now obvious that he thought he was going to waltz into Kyiv, seize it in a week, install a lackey as president, tuck Ukraine into his pocket and put to an end any further European Union, NATO or Western cultural expansion toward Russia. He would then cast his shadow across all of Europe.</p><p>This leads to fact No. 3: Putin has put himself in a situation where he can’t win, can’t lose and can’t stop. There’s no way he can seize control of all of Ukraine anymore. But at the same time, he can’t afford to be defeated, after all the Russian lives and treasure he has expended. So he can’t stop.</p><p>To put it differently, because Putin never had a Plan B, he’s defaulted to a punitive, often indiscriminate rocketing of Ukrainian towns and civilian infrastructure — a grinding war of attrition — with the hope that he can somehow drain enough blood from Ukrainians, and instill enough exhaustion in Kyiv’s Western allies, that they give him a big enough slice of Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine he can sell to the Russian people as a great victory.</p><p>Putin’s Plan B is to disguise that Putin’s Plan A has failed. If this military operation had an honest name, it would be called Operation Save My Face.</p><p>Which makes this one of the sickest, most senseless wars in modern times — a leader destroying another country’s civilian infrastructure until it gives him enough cover to hide the fact that he’s been a towering fool.</p></div><div><p>You can see from Putin’s Victory Day <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/05/09/russia-victory-day-parade-ukraine-putin/\">speech</a> in Moscow on Tuesday that he is now grasping for any rationale to justify a war he started out of his personal fantasy that Ukraine is not a real country but part of Russia. He claimed his invasion was provoked by Western “globalists and elites” who “talk about their exclusivity, pit people and split society, provoke bloody conflicts and upheavals, sow hatred, Russophobia, aggressive nationalism and destroy traditional family values that make a person a person.”</p><p>Wow. Putin invaded Ukraine to preserve Russian family values. Who knew? That’s a leader struggling to explain to his people why he started a war with a puny neighbor that he says is not a real country.</p><p>You might ask, why does a dictator like Putin feel he needs a disguise? Can’t he make his people believe whatever he wants?</p><p>I don’t think so. If you look at his behavior, it seems that Putin is quite frightened today by two subjects: arithmetic and Russian history.</p><p>To understand why these subjects frighten him, you need to first consider the atmosphere enveloping him — something neatly captured, as it happens, in lyrics from the song “Everybody Talks” by one of my favorite rock groups, Neon Trees. The key refrain is:</p><blockquote><p>Hey, baby, won’t you look my way?<br>I can be your new addiction.<br>Hey, baby, what you got to say?<br>All you’re giving me is fiction.<br>I’m a sorry sucker, and this happens all the time.<br>I find out that everybody talks.<br>Everybody talks, everybody talks.<br>It started with a whisper.</p></blockquote><p>One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned as a foreign affairs writer reporting from autocratic countries is that no matter how tightly controlled a place is, no matter how brutal and iron-fisted its dictator, EVERYBODY TALKS.</p></div><div><p>They know who is stealing, who is cheating, who is lying, who is having an affair with whom. It starts with a whisper and often stays there, but everybody talks.</p><p>Putin clearly knows this, too. He knows that even if he gets a few more kilometers of eastern Ukraine and holds Crimea, the minute he stops this war, his people will all do the cruel arithmetic on his Plan B — starting with subtraction.</p><p>The White House <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/05/01/world/russia-ukraine-news\">reported</a> last week that an estimated 100,000 Russian fighters have been killed or wounded in Ukraine in just the past five months and roughly 200,000 killed or wounded since Putin started this war in February 2022.</p><p>That is a big number of casualties — even in a big country — and you can see that Putin is worried that his people are talking about it, because, beyond criminalizing any form of dissent, in April he rushed through a new law cracking down on draft dodging. Now anyone who doesn’t show up will face restrictions on banking, selling property, even getting a driver’s license.</p><p>Putin would not be going to such lengths if he was not fearful that, despite his best efforts, everyone was whispering about how badly the war is going and how to avoid serving there.</p></div><div><p>Read the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/05/03/mariupol-occupied-photos-dread-suspicion/\">recent essay</a> in The Washington Post by Leon Aron, a historian of Putin’s Russia and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, about Putin’s visit in March to the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol.</p><p>“Two days after the International Criminal Court charged Putin with war crimes and issued a warrant for his arrest,” Aron wrote, “the Russian president came to Mariupol for a few hours. He was filmed stopping by the ‘<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://meduza.io/news/2023/03/20/vo-vremya-vstrechi-putina-s-zhitelyami-mariupolya-kto-to-kriknul-eto-vse-nepravda-eto-vse-napokaz-etot-moment-popal-na-video-kremlya\">Nevsky microdistrict</a>,’ inspecting a new apartment and listening for a few minutes to the effusively grateful occupants. As he was leaving, a barely audible voice is heard on the video, crying out from a distance: ‘<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://meduza.io/news/2023/03/20/vo-vremya-vstrechi-putina-s-zhitelyami-mariupolya-kto-to-kriknul-eto-vse-nepravda-eto-vse-napokaz-etot-moment-popal-na-video-kremlya\">Eto vsyo nepravda!</a>’ — ‘It’s all lies!’”</p><p>Aron told me that the Russian media later scrubbed “It’s all lies” from the audio, but the fact that it had been left in there may have been a subversive act by someone in the official Russian media hierarchy. Everybody talks.</p><p>Which leads to the other thing Putin knows: “The gods of Russian history are extremely unforgiving of military defeat,” Aron said. In the modern era, “when a Russian leader ends a war in a clear defeat — or with no win — usually there is a change of regime. We saw that after the first Crimean War, after the Russo-Japanese war, after Russia’s setbacks in World War I, after Khrushchev’s retreat from Cuba in 1962 and after Brezhnev and company’s Afghanistan quagmire, which hastened Gorbachev’s perestroika-and-glasnost revolution. The Russian people, for all their renowned patience, will forgive a lot of things — but not military defeat.”</p><p>It’s for these reasons that Aron, who just finished a book about Putin’s Russia, argues that this Ukraine conflict is far from over and could get a lot worse before it is.</p></div><div><p>“There are now two ways for Putin to end this war he cannot win and cannot walk away from,” Aron said. “One is to continue until Ukraine is bled dry and/or the Ukraine fatigue sets in in the West.”</p><p>And the other, he argued, “is to somehow force a direct confrontation with the U.S. — bring us to the precipice of an all-out strategic nuclear exchange — and then step back and propose to a scared West an overall settlement, which would include a neutral, disarmed Ukraine and his holding on to the Crimea and Donbas.”</p><p>It’s impossible to get into Putin’s head and predict his next move, but color me worried. Because what we do know, from Putin’s actions, is that he knows his Plan A has failed. And he will now do anything to produce a Plan B to justify the terrible losses that he has piled up in the name of a country where everybody talks and where defeated leaders don’t retire peacefully.</p><p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\"><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.

			"content": "A three-stop tour by China’s foreign minister this week has everyone trying to balance economic and security interests when it comes to Russia and Ukraine.  China’s top diplomat set out on a three-nation trip Tuesday to persuade European leaders that they can do business with Beijing, even as the Chinese tried to keep faith with their “unlimited partnership” with a Russia that has plunged Europe into war. But arriving in Berlin, Foreign Minister Qin Gang was quickly confronted about the war in Ukraine. “Neutrality means taking the side of the aggressor, and that is why our guiding principle is to make it clear that we are on the side of the victim,” the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, declared at a joint news conference after they met. Beijing, she said, could be doing much more to help bring the war to an end. Mr. Qin defended his nation’s approach. “The Ukraine issue is of high complexity,” he insisted. “China did not cause this, nor is it a party, but we are committed to peace negotiations.” He said that China would continue to seek a cease-fire and pledged that it would “neither watch the fire from the other bank nor add fuel to the fire.”  Mr. Macron said that Europe should be pursuing its own interests and “strategic autonomy” and “not get caught up in crises that are not ours.” He suggested that the fate of Taiwan was not a central issue for Europe, and argued that Europe should not blindly follow the United States in its rivalry with China. Even if some read too much into Mr. Macron’s words, they were music to Chinese ears, given Beijing’s goal of trying to divide Europe from the United States. In Berlin on Tuesday, Mr. Qin hit some the same themes that Mr. Macron did. “China supports Europe’s self-chosen development path, supports its European strategic autonomy, and it also maintains a steady and stable European policy,” he said.  Caught between wanting to support Russia, woo Europe and stabilize relations with its most important rival, the United States, China has proposed a set of weak proposals for a possible peace between Russia and Ukraine. Few take them very seriously, especially with the fighting likely to intensify soon, but some officials and analysts suggest that China may prove useful down the road in helping guarantee any cease-fire or settlement.  China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is seen as one of the few voices that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia might heed. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has also spoken with Mr. Xi, who phoned him last month after much urging from the Ukrainian leader. But senior European and American officials do not believe that either Mr. Putin or Mr. Zelensky is ready for serious peace talks, or even that Mr. Xi is willing to press Mr. Putin for peace. They believe that China, given its rivalry with the United States, is eager for Mr. Putin not to be seen as losing his war and thereby risk losing power. Much will depend, as ever, on the situation on the battlefield after Ukraine wages a much-anticipated counteroffensive. Even if Ukraine gains considerable ground, U.S. and European officials do not expect Russian troops to collapse or to flee from all sovereign Ukrainian territory. But if Ukraine has great success, it may be more willing to discuss a settlement.  It is less clear that Mr. Putin will have any interest in doing so, believing that time is on his side, with the United States and the larger NATO alliance growing tired of the long war. On Tuesday, Mr. Qin, who after France was to travel to Norway, emphasized Europe’s key economic ties to China. “China should be a key asset for Europe in combating challenges,” he said, “and we welcome Europe to further participate in the market and development opportunities of China, so that both Chinese modernization and the European integration process continue to prosper.”  The proposed sanctions could touch a number of Chinese companies, but Mr. Qin said that Chinese and Russian companies enjoy “normal exchanges and cooperation” which “should not be affected.” Tensions with China are hardly limited to Europe. When the U.S. ambassador to Beijing, Nicholas Burns, met on Monday with Mr. Qin, their exchanges were polite but pointed; it was their first meeting since relations were frozen by the dispute over the Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down over the United States in February. Mr. Qin told Mr. Burns that “the agenda of dialogue and cooperation agreed by the two sides has been disrupted, and the relationship between the two countries has once again hit the cold ice,” according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement. But stabilizing ties with Washington remains a “top priority,” he said.",

			"content": "Dr. Geoffrey Hinton is leaving Google so that he can freely share his concern that artificial intelligence could cause the world serious harm.Credit...Chloe Ellingson for The New York Times  For half a century, Geoffrey Hinton nurtured the technology at the heart of chatbots like ChatGPT. Now he worries it will cause serious harm.  Dr. Geoffrey Hinton is leaving Google so that he can freely share his concern that artificial intelligence could cause the world serious harm.  Geoffrey Hinton was an artificial intelligence pioneer. In 2012, Dr. Hinton and two of his graduate students at the University of Toronto created technology that became the intellectual foundation for the A.I. systems that the tech industry’s biggest companies believe is a key to their future. On Monday, however, he officially joined a growing chorus of critics who say those companies are racing toward danger with their aggressive campaign to create products based on generative artificial intelligence, the technology that powers popular chatbots like ChatGPT. Dr. Hinton said he has quit his job at Google, where he has worked for more than a decade and became one of the most respected voices in the field, so he can freely speak out about the risks of A.I. A part of him, he said, now regrets his life’s work. “I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn’t done it, somebody else would have,” Dr. Hinton said during a lengthy interview last week in the dining room of his home in Toronto, a short walk from where he and his students made their breakthrough.  Dr. Hinton’s journey from A.I. groundbreaker to doomsayer marks a remarkable moment for the technology industry at perhaps its most important inflection point in decades. Industry leaders believe the new A.I. systems could be as important as the introduction of the web browser in the early 1990s and could lead to breakthroughs in areas ranging from drug research to education. But gnawing at many industry insiders is a fear that they are releasing something dangerous into the wild. Generative A.I. can already be a tool for misinformation. Soon, it could be a risk to jobs. Somewhere down the line, tech’s biggest worriers say, it could be a risk to humanity. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” Dr. Hinton said. After the San Francisco start-up OpenAI released a new version of ChatGPT in March, more than 1,000 technology leaders and researchers signed an open letter calling for a six-month moratorium on the development of new systems because A.I. technologies pose “profound risks to society and humanity.” Several days later, 19 current and former leaders of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, a 40-year-old academic society, released their own letter warning of the risks of A.I. That group included Eric Horvitz, chief scientific officer at Microsoft, which has deployed OpenAI’s technology across a wide range of products, including its Bing search engine.  Dr. Hinton, often called “the Godfather of A.I.,” did not sign either of those letters and said he did not want to publicly criticize Google or other companies until he had quit his job. He notified the company last month that he was resigning, and on Thursday, he talked by phone with Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google’s parent company, Alphabet. He declined to publicly discuss the details of his conversation with Mr. Pichai. Google’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, said in a statement: “We remain committed to a responsible approach to A.I. We’re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.” Dr. Hinton, a 75-year-old British expatriate, is a lifelong academic whose career was driven by his personal convictions about the development and use of A.I. In 1972, as a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh, Dr. Hinton embraced an idea called a neural network. A neural network is a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing data. At the time, few researchers believed in the idea. But it became his life’s work. In the 1980s, Dr. Hinton was a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, but left the university for Canada because he said he was reluctant to take Pentagon funding. At the time, most A.I. research in the United States was funded by the Defense Department. Dr. Hinton is deeply opposed to the use of artificial intelligence on the battlefield — what he calls “robot soldiers.” In 2012, Dr. Hinton and two of his students in Toronto, Ilya Sutskever and Alex Krishevsky, built a neural network that could analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to identify common objects, such as flowers, dogs and cars.  Around the same time, Google, OpenAI and other companies began building neural networks that learned from huge amounts of digital text. Dr. Hinton thought it was a powerful way for machines to understand and generate language, but it was inferior to the way humans handled language. Then, last year, as Google and OpenAI built systems using much larger amounts of data, his view changed. He still believed the systems were inferior to the human brain in some ways but he thought they were eclipsing human intelligence in others. “Maybe what is going on in these systems,” he said, “is actually a lot better than what is going on in the brain.” As companies improve their A.I. systems, he believes, they become increasingly dangerous. “Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now,” he said of A.I. technology. “Take the difference and propagate it forwards. That’s scary.”  Until last year, he said, Google acted as a “proper steward” for the technology, careful not to release something that might cause harm. But now that Microsoft has augmented its Bing search engine with a chatbot — challenging Google’s core business — Google is racing to deploy the same kind of technology. The tech giants are locked in a competition that might be impossible to stop, Dr. Hinton said. His immediate concern is that the internet will be flooded with false photos, videos and text, and the average person will “not be able to know what is true anymore.” He is also worried that A.I. technologies will in time upend the job market. Today, chatbots like ChatGPT tend to complement human workers, but they could replace paralegals, personal assistants, translators and others who handle rote tasks. “It takes away the drudge work,” he said. “It might take away more than that.” Down the road, he is worried that future versions of the technology pose a threat to humanity because they often learn unexpected behavior from the vast amounts of data they analyze. This becomes an issue, he said, as individuals and companies allow A.I. systems not only to generate their own computer code but actually run that code on their own. And he fears a day when truly autonomous weapons — those killer robots — become reality. “The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” he said. “But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.”  Many other experts, including many of his students and colleagues, say this threat is hypothetical. But Dr. Hinton believes that the race between Google and Microsoft and others will escalate into a global race that will not stop without some sort of global regulation. But that may be impossible, he said. Unlike with nuclear weapons, he said, there is no way of knowing whether companies or countries are working on the technology in secret. The best hope is for the world’s leading scientists to collaborate on ways of controlling the technology. “I don’t think they should scale this up more until they have understood whether they can control it,” he said. Dr. Hinton said that when people used to ask him how he could work on technology that was potentially dangerous, he would paraphrase Robert Oppenheimer, who led the U.S. effort to build the atomic bomb: “When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it.” He does not say that anymore.",

			"content": "The black turtlenecks are gone. So is the voice. As the convicted Theranos founder awaits prison, she has adopted a new persona: devoted mother.  Elizabeth Holmes blends in with the other moms here, in a bucket hat and sunglasses, her newborn strapped to her chest and swathed in a Baby Yoda nursing blanket. We walk past a family of caged orangutans and talk about how Ms. Holmes is preparing to go to prison for one of the most notorious cases of corporate fraud in recent history. In case you’re wondering, Ms. Holmes speaks in a soft, slightly low, but totally unremarkable voice, no hint of the throaty contralto she used while running her defunct blood-testing start-up Theranos. “I made so many mistakes and there was so much I didn’t know and understand, and I feel like when you do it wrong, it’s like you really internalize it in a deep way,” Ms. Holmes said as we stopped to look at a hissing anaconda. Billy Evans, Ms. Holmes’s partner and the father of their two young children, pushes a stroller with the couple’s 20-month-old son, William. William enjoys playing in the sand, “The Little Blue Truck,” dumplings and, like his mom, already speaks some Mandarin. But William especially loves the San Diego Zoo, which is why, on a recent Thursday afternoon, I found myself in the surreal situation of trying to make sense of Ms. Holmes’s version of her rise and fall, while watching a restless cheetah and buying a gorilla T-shirt at the gift shop.  “How would you spend your time if you didn’t know how much time you had left?” Ms. Holmes said, her impending prison report date top of mind, perhaps even more so given that we were surrounded by animals behind bars. “It would be the kind of things we’re doing now because they’re perfect. Just being together.” Ms. Holmes has not spoken to the media since 2016, when her legal team advised she go quiet. And, as the adage goes, if you don’t feed the press, we feed on you. In Elizabeth Holmes, we found an all-you-can-eat buffet. It had everything: The black turtlenecks, the Kabuki red lipstick, the green juices, the dancing to Lil Wayne. Somewhere along the way, Ms. Holmes says that the person (whoever that is) got lost. At one point, I tell her that I heard Jennifer Lawrence had pulled out of portraying her in a movie. She replied, almost reflectively, “They’re not playing me. They’re playing a character I created.” So, why did she create that public persona? “I believed it would be how I would be good at business and taken seriously and not taken as a little girl or a girl who didn’t have good technical ideas,” said Ms. Holmes, who founded Theranos at 19. “Maybe people picked up on that not being authentic, since it wasn’t.” Ten years ago, Ms. Holmes was the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire, worth $4.5 billion (on paper, in Theranos stock), and one of the most visible and celebrated female C.E.O.s on the planet, running a start-up with a $9 billion valuation. Then, in 2015, The Wall Street Journal published an investigation into Theranos, calling into question whether its labs and technology — a sleek, boxy device called the Edison — actually worked as promised, testing for a wide range of illnesses with a tiny amount of blood collected with a rapid finger prick. In 2016, federal inspectors from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services found “deficient practices” in a Theranos lab that posed “immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.”  If you didn’t know she was that Elizabeth, whose trajectory launched a cottage industry of podcasts, TV shows, Halloween costumes and groupies who sold blonde wigs outside her trial, then you might sit next to her at the Lucha Libre taco shop in Mission Hills without thinking twice. This is when Billy puts on the deep voice. The guttural one that the world heard in Ms. Holmes’s TED Talk and CNBC appearances and in the actress Amanda Seyfried’s Emmy-award-winning turn as Ms. Holmes in Hulu’s “The Dropout.” If you hate Elizabeth Holmes, you probably think her feigned perma-hoarseness was part of an elaborate scheme to defraud investors. If you are a person who is sympathetic to Ms. Holmes, then the James Earl Jones inflection was a sign of the impossible gymnastics that female founders must perform to be taken seriously. If you spend time with Ms. Holmes, as I did, then you might come away like me, and think that, as with many things about Elizabeth Holmes, it was both. Either way, even Mr. Evans agrees, the voice was real weird. He was driving the family’s Tesla. Ms. Holmes climbed in, after strapping the babies, calm and happy, into their carseats. I rode shotgun. “That would be crazy, if she answered the door and said, ‘Hi. I’m Elizabeth Holmes,” Mr. Evans said, imitating the voice. Ms. Holmes let out the slightest of giggles from the back seat. I realized that I was essentially writing a story about two different people. There was Elizabeth, celebrated in the media as a rock-star inventor whose brilliance dazzled illustrious rich men, and whose criminal trial captivated the world. Then there is “Liz,” (as Mr. Evans and her friends call her), the mom of two who, for the past year, has been volunteering for a rape crisis hotline. Who can’t stomach R-rated movies and who rushed after me one afternoon with a paper towel to wipe a mix of sand and her dog’s slobber off my shoe.  After Ms. Holmes was convicted, Rupert Murdoch, who invested $125 million in Theranos, emailed The Wall Street Journal, a newspaper he owns, calling himself “one of a bunch of old men taken in by a seemingly great young woman! Total embarrassment.” I am not a smarter or more astute observer of human behavior than Mr. Murdoch or George Shultz, the former secretary of state who helped end the Cold War, or James Mattis, the retired four-star Marine Corps general and former defense secretary, both of whom were Theranos board members and investors. So, how could I be sure that “Liz” wasn’t another character that Ms. Holmes had created? I was admittedly swept up in Liz as an authentic and sympathetic person. She’s gentle and charismatic, in a quiet way. My editor laughed at me when I shared these impressions, telling me (and I quote), “Amy Chozick, you got rolled!” I vigorously disagreed! You don’t know her like I do! But then, something very strange happened. I worked my way through a list of Ms. Holmes’s friends, family and longtime supporters, whom she and Mr. Evans suggested I speak to. One of these friends said Ms. Holmes had genuine intentions at Theranos and didn’t deserve a lengthy prison sentence. Then, this person requested anonymity to caution me not to believe everything Ms. Holmes says. This warning stuck with me, and it got at something that had been gnawing on me since I first met Ms. Holmes. How do you have an honest conversation with a person whose fraud trial has played out so publicly? I tried to ask Ms. Holmes this directly. How do I believe you when you’ve been convicted of (basically) lying? But how could I ask someone who was nursing her 11-day-old baby on a white sofa two feet away if she was actually conning me? It was in these uncomfortable exchanges that Mr. Evans often stepped in. “Your question is, ‘How do you say anything when everything you say is going to be doubted?’ You just have to say it,” he said.  “If we let how other people might view that, or what impression someone might make of it dictate how we live our lives, then we’ve lost,” Ms. Holmes said. “Finding your person in the middle of all of this and experiencing that love when you’re going through hell is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever experienced.” I’d hardly sat down in Ms. Holmes’s and Mr. Evans’s home the first time we met in person, when Ms. Holmes told me about her work at the rape-crisis hotline. She’d just finished a 12-hour shift, which she does a few times a week from home using her cellphone, answering calls when they come in. She then put this work into context, telling me how surviving a rape at a fraternity party her sophomore year at Stanford had, in retrospect, colored so many of her life choices. It’s the part of her story that she keeps getting back to. The one she told a sympathetic, but ultimately undeterred jury, according to news reports. The one she wants people to (finally) listen to. (I later reviewed a 52-page Santa Clara police report that documented the details of the alleged sexual assault and Ms. Holmes’s injuries. Ms. Holmes did not press charges.) Ms. Holmes hands the baby to Mr. Evans. “I’ll give her to you when we’re talking about this stuff,” she said. She continued, “I woke up with this guy who was my friend having sex with me and I couldn’t get him off of me.” Ms. Holmes said the assault, in October 2003, contributed to her decision to drop out several months later and start a company. To help her do that, she turned to Mr. Balwani, known as Sunny, whom she first met in 2002 on a college trip to China. Ms. Holmes was 18. Mr. Balwani was 37 and had already successfully founded and sold a tech company.  A mutual friend introduced him to Ms. Holmes and the pair talked for three hours. “My friends were texting, ‘Where are you? We’re here,” Mr. Evans recalled. “To say we immediately fell in love isn’t an overstatement.” Mr. Evans was 25 and living with roommates in San Francisco, but in many ways he was more mature than Ms. Holmes. She was 32 and had never opened a bottle of wine. “Elizabeth lived in complete isolation with Sunny,” her father, Christian Holmes IV, told me. “It’s hard to explain the extent to which she missed so much of the growing up that someone does in their 20s.” As Theranos settled an onslaught of civil lawsuits and federal prosecutors closed in on criminal charges, Ms. Holmes started to socialize again, reconnecting with family and friends. “Despite everything going horribly in her life, we had our daughter back, and it was wonderful to see how she used to be,” her mother, Noel Holmes, said. Ms. Holmes and Mr. Evans quickly became more than friends and moved in together. “It had been two years of all this stuff written about me, and I think you get to know someone in a totally different way when you walk in with that skepticism versus if you meet when everything is sunshine and roses,” Ms. Holmes said. “That allowed us to get to know each other in a really deep way.” In 2018, the Justice Department indicted Ms. Holmes, accusing her of lying when she told investors that Theranos’s devices could quickly perform a full range of clinical blood tests using a finger prick, even though she knew the tests were unreliable, limited and slow. The much-hyped box didn’t do much of anything. And most of the promises that put Ms. Holmes on the map turned out to be fiction.  The morning we went to the zoo, Mr. Evans stopped at Starbucks. He returned to find the barista had written “Billy the Kid” on his coffee cup. Ms. Holmes didn’t get the reference. Mr. Evans took a few calls for work while I was visiting. I asked what he does. “A lot of different stuff, investing, starting companies,” he replied, without elaborating. How is Ms. Holmes paying her legal expenses? “I can’t,” she said. “I have to work for the rest of my life to try to pay for it.” I asked if Mr. Evans’s family was helping to cover her legal expenses. She shook her head no. An earlier legal team quit after Ms. Holmes could not pay them. One pre-sentencing report by the government put her legal fees at more than $30 million. Ms. Holmes did not detail how those fees would be paid, and her current representatives at Williams & Connolly did not respond to emails asking about her financial arrangement. Their toddler, William, recently had a 105-degree fever, the couple said. They raced him to the emergency room. The first thing the attending doctor said was, “You look a lot like that horrible woman.” Ms. Holmes looked at him with her piercing blue eyes, and said, “I’m sure you’re a better person than she is.” The doctor seemed to realize who he was talking to. She continued, “Then he said, ‘Are you Elizabeth Holmes?’ And I said, ‘Yes,’ and he said, ‘I am so sorry,’ and I said, ‘Don’t be, all you know is what you’ve read.’” By Billy’s father, William L. Evans’s tally, there are “over 67,600,600” web results on Ms. Holmes, all of them negative, compared with “21 million results, many of which are positive” for Osama bin Laden, figures he wrote in a letter to the court. Ms. Holmes’s mother, Noel, said she stopped cold in a Barnes & Noble when she saw her daughter characterized in a book display as a “paranoid sociopath” who is “devoid of conscience.”  “I’m still thinking about the journalists being intimidated,” Ms. Holmes said after we’d moved on to several other topics. “As I said at trial, I completely wish we’d handled that situation differently.” She tears up. “I take responsibility for it because I was C.E.O. of the company and at the end of the day, that’s that, but I don’t believe in people being treated that way, period.” (In response to Ms. Holmes seemingly casting blame on her legal team, a spokeswoman for Mr. Boies texted, “Whatever.”) Ms. Holmes chooses her words carefully when I ask if the prominent men who invested and joined the Theranos board were drawn to the start-up partly because the founder was an attractive young woman. “A lot of people were attracted to this for their own reasons,” she said. What does she think would have happened if she hadn’t garnered so much early attention as the second coming of Silicon Valley? Ms. Holmes does not blink: “We would’ve seen through our vision.” In other words, she thinks if she’d spent more time quietly working on her inventions and less time on a stage promoting the company, she would have revolutionized health care by now. This kind of misguided talk is the one consistent thread in my reporting on who Ms. Holmes really is. She repeatedly says that Theranos wasn’t a get-rich-quick scheme for her; she never sold her shares and didn’t come out of it wealthy. Ms. Holmes’s parents said they borrowed $500,000 against their Washington, D.C.-area home to post Ms. Holmes’s bond. I can’t shake an earlier story that Mr. Evans relayed. In the waning days of Theranos, Ms. Holmes got a dog, a Siberian husky named Balto. Last year, when a mountain lion carried Balto away from the front porch, Ms. Holmes spent 16 hours searching in the woods, digging through brambles and poison oak, hoping to find him alive. Everyone knew Balto was dead, but Ms. Holmes kept searching. The relentlessness. The certainty. The fanaticism. It’s the same way Ms. Holmes kept hanging on at Theranos.  It’s this steadfast (or unhinged?) belief that has kept Ms. Holmes fighting, even though a guilty plea would have likely helped her chances of remaining free. “She could have said, ‘Yes, I lied, and I tried my best to save mankind, but this happened in my enthusiasm,’” her father told me. “But she has taken the position that she is not guilty and that takes guts.” Ms. Holmes eventually found her beloved husky, Balto, in the woods. But by then the dog was gone, torn apart by the mountain lion. The last day I spent with Ms. Holmes, I parked and walked up the long driveway to find her and Mr. Evans embracing in the kitchen. They looked like they were slow dancing, swaying slightly, the two of them against the world. Fireplace burning. Seagulls flying overhead. Teddy drooling in his crate. Babies (plural) sleeping. Mr. Evans left for a workout, saying he doesn’t want “dad bod.” Ms. Holmes and I sat at the kitchen table alone, talking. She didn’t seem like a hero or a villain. She seemed, like most people, somewhere in between. As Ms. Holmes broke down thinking about what her children will be like in 11 years, I kept going back to her central promise at Theranos: The technology that she invented would, in her words, create “a world in which no one ever has to say goodbye too soon.” And there she was, preparing to do just that. That Friday, the couple were getting ready to host a group of friends from the Bay Area. They invited me to stay. They repeatedly invited me to come back, to bring my family. We could all go to the zoo together.",

The jury heard from several patients, including one who said a Theranos blood test revealed she was having a miscarriage when, in fact, she had a healthy pregnancy. Ms. Holmes was not convicted on any counts related to patients. But the testimony was a stark reminder of the human stakes of choosing biotech as your start-up.</p><p>Ms. Holmes was found guilty in January 2022 on four of 11 charges that she defrauded Theranos investors out of more than $100 million. Her top lieutenant at Theranos, and much older boyfriend at the time, Ramesh Balwani, was found guilty of 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud at Theranos. He began a 13-year prison sentence last month. On Thursday, his legal team filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit.</p><p>During the closely followed proceedings, a prosecutor, Robert Leach, said this was a case “about fraud, about lying and cheating,” alleging that Theranos raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors by misleading them about its blood-testing technology’s capabilities.</p></div><div><p>Lance Wade, a lawyer for Ms. Holmes, said that his client “made mistakes, but mistakes are not crimes.”</p><p>By the time I met Ms. Holmes and Mr. Evans, they were counting the days until April 27, when she had been required to report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, for 11.25 years. (Shortly before she was due at prison, Ms. Holmes made a last-minute request to remain free pending an appeal, which automatically delayed her report date by an undetermined amount of time.)</p><p>Day 44: the afternoon we ordered in Mexican food at their quaint rental home near the Pacific.</p><p>Day 43: the morning we went for breakfast and Ms. Holmes breastfed her baby, Invicta (Latin for “invincible”) and sang along to Ace of Base’s “All That She Wants” on the loudspeakers (“This is the first album I ever owned.”).</p><p>Day 42: the time we had croissants and berries and Mr. Evans made coffee and we walked the couple’s 150-pound Great Dane-mastiff mix, Teddy, on the beach.</p><p>On the second day we spent together, Mr. Evans asked me what the most surprising part of spending so much time with Ms. Holmes was.

If you spend time with Ms. Holmes, as I did, then you might come away like me, and think that, as with many things about Elizabeth Holmes, it was both.

Who can’t stomach R-rated movies and who rushed after me one afternoon with a paper towel to wipe a mix of sand and her dog’s slobber off my shoe.</p></div><div><p>After Ms. Holmes was convicted, Rupert Murdoch, who invested $125 million in Theranos, emailed<em> </em>The Wall Street Journal, a newspaper he owns, calling himself “one of a bunch of old men taken in by a seemingly great young woman! Total embarrassment.” I am not a smarter or more astute observer of human behavior than Mr. Murdoch or George Shultz, the former secretary of state who helped end the Cold War, or James Mattis, the retired four-star Marine Corps general and former defense secretary, both of whom were Theranos board members and investors. So, how could I be sure that “Liz” wasn’t another character that Ms. Holmes had created?</p><p>I was admittedly swept up in Liz as an authentic and sympathetic person. She’s gentle and charismatic, in a quiet way. My editor laughed at me when I shared these impressions, telling me (and I quote), “Amy Chozick, you got rolled!” I vigorously disagreed! You don’t know her like I do! But then, something very strange happened. I worked my way through a list of Ms. Holmes’s friends, family and longtime supporters, whom she and Mr. Evans suggested I speak to. One of these friends said Ms. Holmes had genuine intentions at Theranos and didn’t deserve a lengthy prison sentence. Then, this person requested anonymity to caution me not to believe everything Ms. Holmes says.</p><p>This warning stuck with me, and it got at something that had been gnawing on me since I first met Ms. Holmes. How do you have an honest conversation with a person whose fraud trial has played out so publicly? I tried to ask Ms. Holmes this directly. How do I believe you when you’ve been convicted of (basically) lying? But how could I ask someone who was nursing her 11-day-old baby on a white sofa two feet away if she was actually conning me?</p><p>It was in these uncomfortable exchanges that Mr. Evans often stepped in. “Your question is, ‘How do you say anything when everything you say is going to be doubted?’ You just have to say it,” he said.</p></div><div><p>So, to just say it: Ms. Holmes knows what you’re thinking about her trial, and the birth of her two babies.</p></div><div data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\"><figure role=\"group\" aria-label=\"media\"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden=\"false\">Philip Cheung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>When she alerted the court on March 12, 2021, that she was pregnant with her first child, Mr. Leach, the prosecutor, called the news “frustrating.” The trial had already been delayed because of the pandemic, and was pushed back a few more weeks, until after she gave birth that July.</p><p>Which is why she was there in a San Jose federal courthouse using the high-tech Elvie breast pump with its glowing aqua nipples. “She looked like a Fembot,” Mr. Evans said.</p><p>At her sentencing hearing in November 2022, she was visibly pregnant with her second child. That baby was born in February. In March, Ms. Holmes’s defense team partly cited her <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-holmes-second-child-prison-sentence-delay-mother/#:~:text=Elizabeth%20Holmes%20welcomes%20second%20child%20as%20she%20seeks%20to%20delay%20prison%20term&amp;text=Convicted%20fraudster%20Elizabeth%20Holmes%20has,a%20recent%20court%20filing%20revealed.\">“two very young children”</a> in arguing that she should remain free while appealing her fraud conviction. A Daily Mail headline referred to the baby as a “Last-Ditch Bid for New Trial.”</p><p>But, as Ms. Holmes explains it, it’s just bad timing (to put it mildly). She is 39. She fell in love with Mr. Evans in 2017. They did not anticipate that she would be indicted. They did not anticipate that she would be sentenced to 11 years. They always wanted a big family.</p></div><div><p>“If we let how other people might view that, or what impression someone might make of it dictate how we live our lives, then we’ve lost,” Ms. Holmes said. “Finding your person in the middle of all of this and experiencing that love when you’re going through hell is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever experienced.”</p><h2 id=\"link-NaN\">***</h2><p>I’d hardly sat down in Ms. Holmes’s and Mr. Evans’s home the first time we met in person, when Ms. Holmes told me about her work at the rape-crisis hotline. She’d just finished a 12-hour shift, which she does a few times a week from home using her cellphone, answering calls when they come in.</p><p>She then put this work into context, telling me how surviving a rape at a fraternity party her sophomore year at Stanford had, in retrospect, colored so many of her life choices. It’s the part of her story that she keeps getting back to. The one she told a sympathetic, but ultimately undeterred jury, according to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fyGUDrGPAE\">news reports</a>. The one she wants people to (finally) listen to. (I later reviewed a 52-page Santa Clara police report that documented the details of the alleged sexual assault and Ms. Holmes’s injuries. Ms. Holmes did not press charges.)</p><p>Ms. Holmes hands the baby to Mr. Evans. “I’ll give her to you when we’re talking about this stuff,” she said. She continued, “I woke up with this guy who was my friend having sex with me and I couldn’t get him off of me.” Ms. Holmes said the assault, in October 2003, contributed to her decision to drop out several months later and start a company.</p><p>To help her do that, she turned to Mr. Balwani, known as Sunny, whom she first met in 2002 on a college trip to China. Ms. Holmes was 18. Mr. Balwani was 37 and had already successfully founded and sold a tech company.</p></div><div><p>In March 2004, her sophomore year, Ms. Holmes left Stanford and moved in with Mr. Balwani to get Theranos off the ground. (Mr. Balwani guaranteed a loan to Theranos and joined the company in 2009.) “I really thought I’d be safe,” Ms. Holmes said. “My friends at school and that whole universe, it didn’t exist anymore when I was with him. It was all gone.”</p><p>As Ms. Holmes explained it, echoing a key part of her defense strategy, Mr. Balwani kept close control over her every action. She detailed extensive domestic abuse and sexual assault. She said that Mr. Balwani forced her to stop speaking to her family and Stanford friends and pressured her to adopt the black-turtleneck, red-lipstick persona.</p><p>“He always told me I needed to ‘kill Elizabeth,’ so I could become a good entrepreneur,” she said.</p><p>Jeffrey Coopersmith, a lawyer for Mr. Balwani, denied the allegations. “Our client is not a person who is vindictive or mean spirited or aggressive,” he said.</p><p>She lived by entrepreneurial tenets that she said Mr. Balwani told her she needed to follow in order to succeed. These included not sleeping for more than five hours, going vegan, getting to the office daily by 5 a.m., no alcohol.</p><p>“It was only when people started to raise questions about the company that I started to see that he was not who I thought he was in business,” Ms. Holmes said of Mr. Balwani. “And then that made me start to question everything else.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\"><figure role=\"group\" aria-label=\"media\"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden=\"false\">The device Theranos called “Edison.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden=\"false\">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>One of the last times we spoke, I asked Ms. Holmes to clarify what she meant. As C.E.O., wasn’t she in charge? She said Mr. Balwani did not control her every interaction or statement at Theranos, but she “deferred to him in the areas he oversaw because I believed he knew better than I did,” and those areas included the problematic clinical lab.</p><p>Mr. Balwani’s lawyer, Mr. Coopersmith, said his client was in regular contact with Ms. Holmes about any issues at the lab, adding that she “was a strong woman who had a vision and Sunny was helping her execute her vision.”</p><p>Ms. Holmes’s story of how she got here — to the bright, cozy house and the supportive partner and the two babies — feels a lot like the story of someone who had finally broken out of a cult and been deprogrammed. After her relationship with Mr. Balwani ended and Theranos dissolved, Ms. Holmes said, “I began my life again.”</p><p>But then I remember that Ms. Holmes was running the cult.</p><h2 id=\"link-NaN\">***</h2><p>In person, Ms. Holmes is engaging, but she is also somewhat socially stunted. It’s as if Rip Van Winkle fell asleep in his early 20s in a start-up and woke up a 32-year-old at Burning Man. That’s because in the 14 years Ms. Holmes led Theranos she didn’t do any of the normal things 20-somethings do, according to her friends and family. Ms. Holmes had so few actual friends, she said, when she was running Theranos that she once pulled a female pharmaceutical executive aside to ask if the way Mr. Balwani treated her was normal in a relationship. However — the same person who warned me about Ms. Holmes pointed out that she seemed to have plenty of wealthy, famous friends in this period.</p></div><div><p>In 2015, when <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901?mod=article_inline\">The Wall Street Journal</a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901?mod=article_inline\"><em> </em></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901?mod=article_inline\">first reported</a> on serious flaws in Theranos’s technology, Debbie Sterling, an entrepreneur and classmate<span>  </span>of Ms. Holmes’s from Stanford, reached out asking if Ms. Holmes needed someone to talk to. “She said, ‘I don’t have any friends. I only work, from the first thing in the morning until late at night,’” Ms. Sterling recalled. “It was kinda creepy.” She corrects herself: “Not creepy, but concerning.” They eventually met for breakfast in Palo Alto.</p><p>Ms. Sterling said she thought about her friend as two distinct people: There was “black turtleneck Elizabeth” and there was “real Elizabeth.” Ms. Sterling, along with several other Stanford friends, attended the trial to support Ms. Holmes. But first she bought brown drugstore hair dye, worried that being seen there might impugn her reputation.</p><p>In 2016, as regulators scrutinized Theranos, Mr. Balwani resigned. Theranos shut down its clinical laboratory and laid off roughly 40 percent of its estimated 790 employees. Ms. Holmes’s brother (and Theranos executive), Christian Holmes V, helped her pack up and move out of the mansion she’d shared with Mr. Balwani. Ms. Holmes, barred from working in a medical laboratory for two years, checked into a hotel and then rented a two-bedroom home in Los Altos. She had almost no belongings, so her parents sent her some ’90s chintz furniture that they had in storage.</p></div><div data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\"><figure role=\"group\" aria-label=\"media\"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden=\"false\">Ramesh Balwani leaving court in San Jose after his fraud conviction last year.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden=\"false\">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>In 2017, as Theranos faced an onslaught of legal challenges, both civil and criminal, Ms. Holmes moved to San Francisco, where she met a recent M.I.T. graduate and entrepreneur, Billy Evans, at a house party during Fleet Week to benefit wounded warriors. Mr. Evans had gone out to get ice for a party he was hosting at his own apartment and a friend texted to ask if he was going to the benefit. He agreed to swing by for a few minutes and never made it to back to his party.</p></div><div><p>A mutual friend introduced him to Ms. Holmes and the pair talked for three hours. “My friends were texting, ‘Where are you? We’re here,” Mr. Evans recalled. “To say we immediately fell in love isn’t an overstatement.”</p><p>Mr. Evans was 25 and living with roommates in San Francisco, but in many ways he was more mature than Ms. Holmes. She was 32 and had never opened a bottle of wine. “Elizabeth lived in complete isolation with Sunny,” her father, Christian Holmes IV, told me. “It’s hard to explain the extent to which she missed so much of the growing up that someone does in their 20s.” As Theranos settled an onslaught of civil lawsuits and federal prosecutors closed in on criminal charges, Ms. Holmes started to socialize again, reconnecting with family and friends. “Despite everything going horribly in her life, we had our daughter back, and it was wonderful to see how she used to be,” her mother, Noel Holmes, said.</p><p>Ms. Holmes and Mr. Evans quickly became more than friends and moved in together. “It had been two years of all this stuff written about me, and I think you get to know someone in a totally different way when you walk in with that skepticism versus if you meet when everything is sunshine and roses,” Ms. Holmes said. “That allowed us to get to know each other in a really deep way.”</p><p>In 2018, the Justice Department <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/page/file/1135066/download\">indicted Ms. Holmes</a>, accusing her of lying when she told investors that Theranos’s devices could quickly perform a full range of clinical blood tests using a finger prick, even though she knew the tests were unreliable, limited and slow.</p><p>The much-hyped box didn’t do much of anything. And most of the promises that put Ms. Holmes on the map turned out to be fiction.</p></div><div><p>The Theranos board, failing to find a buyer for the start-up, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/blood-testing-firm-theranos-to-dissolve-1536115130\">eventually dissolved the company</a>.</p><p>Where do you go when your life’s work and reputation go up in flames? … Burning Man.</p><p>Ms. Holmes and Mr. Evans went to the desert oasis for moneyed bohemians. She burned a tribute to Theranos. “There was an incredible sense of grief because I’d given everything to it, my whole life, since I’d been 18,” she said of that period.</p><p>The following year, in 2019, after U.S. District Judge Edward J. Davila set a date for Ms. Holmes’s criminal trial, she and Mr. Evans hit the road. As prosecutors assembled their case, Ms. Holmes and Mr. Evans spent six months traveling the country in an R.V., sleeping in campgrounds and Walmart parking lots. Ms. Holmes balanced outdoor yoga and long hikes in national parks with working on her legal defense.</p><p>I tell Ms. Holmes (in so many words) that it seems like she became blissfully happy just as her life was falling apart. She does not disagree. “Even though that period was a crisis and Theranos was my life and like my child, I gave everything I had to it,” she said. After it was gone, “I also became free.”</p><p>At least, for now.</p><h2 id=\"link-NaN\">***</h2><p>Mr. Evans, whose parents are prominent hoteliers in San Diego, and Ms. Holmes have an us-against-the-world ethos that is both romantic and rings slightly of Bonnie and Clyde. They say they’ve been chased out of residence after residence, no matter how remote. On my way to their front door, I walk past rows of orange storage containers filled with the couple’s personal belongings. They never unpack, Mr. Evans explains, concerned they’ll have to move again when they’re found.</p></div><div><p>The morning we went to the zoo, Mr. Evans stopped at Starbucks. He returned to find the barista had written “Billy the Kid” on his coffee cup. Ms. Holmes didn’t get the reference.</p><p>Mr. Evans took a few calls for work while I was visiting. I asked what he does. “A lot of different stuff, investing, starting companies,” he replied, without elaborating. How is Ms. Holmes paying her legal expenses? “I can’t,” she said. “I have to work for the rest of my life to try to pay for it.” I asked if Mr. Evans’s family was helping to cover her legal expenses. She shook her head no.</p><p>An <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/lawyers-theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-paid-bills-year/story?id=66063299\">earlier legal team quit</a> after Ms. Holmes could not pay them. One <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-18/holmes-sentence-over-theranos-may-set-silicon-valley-example?sref=zVYYYI5e\">pre-sentencing report</a> by the government put her legal fees at more than $30 million. Ms. Holmes did not detail how those fees would be paid, and her current representatives at Williams &amp; Connolly did not respond to emails asking about her financial arrangement.</p><p>Their toddler, William, recently had a 105-degree fever, the couple said. They raced him to the emergency room. The first thing the attending doctor said was, “You look a lot like that horrible woman.” Ms. Holmes looked at him with her piercing blue eyes, and said, “I’m sure you’re a better person than she is.” The doctor seemed to realize who he was talking to. She continued, “Then he said, ‘Are you Elizabeth Holmes?’ And I said, ‘Yes,’ and he said, ‘I am so sorry,’ and I said, ‘Don’t be, all you know is what you’ve read.’”</p><p>By Billy’s father, William L. Evans’s tally, there are “over 67,600,600” web results on Ms. Holmes, all of them negative, compared with “21 million results, many of which are positive” for Osama bin Laden, figures he wrote in a letter to the court. Ms. Holmes’s mother, Noel, said she stopped cold in a Barnes &amp; Noble when she saw her daughter characterized in a book display as a “paranoid sociopath” who is “devoid of conscience.”</p></div><div><p>“Everybody got on the train that Elizabeth was evil, and it was great copy, and they took it and ran with it,” Ms. Holmes’s father, Christian, said.</p><p>Ms. Holmes’s defenders, stretching back to childhood, said in letters to the court, and in conversations with me, that the feverish coverage of Ms. Holmes’s downfall felt like a witch trial, less rooted in what actually happened at Theranos, and more of a message to ambitious women everywhere.<em> Don’t girl boss too close to the sun, or this could happen to you …</em></p><p>“There’s an unspoken lesson for female executives: you’re allowed to be successful but not <em>too</em> successful,” Jackie Lamping, a Kappa Alpha Theta sorority sister of Ms. Holmes at Stanford, wrote in a letter to Judge Davila, who oversaw the trial.</p><p>Ms. Holmes said she believed that making herself the poster girl for women in tech put a huge target on her back. She regrets being the subject of fawning magazine covers (though I imagine the authors of those stories regret it more). “I never lost sight of the mission but I think I did of the narrative,” she said. “The story became this story that was totally snowballed away from what we were actually talking about.”</p><p>Of course, Ms. Holmes also tried to control the story, often with scorched-earth tactics. She is typically docile, but got visibly upset when I asked about how the lawyer David Boies had threatened litigation against people who spoke negatively about Theranos. Alex Shultz, the father of the Theranos employees turned whistle-blower Tyler Shultz, and the son of George Shultz, told the court that Tyler “slept with a knife under his pillow every night thinking that someone was going to come and murder him in the night.” (Ms. Holmes and Mr. Boies parted ways and she replaced her legal team in 2016.)</p></div><div><p>“I’m still thinking about the journalists being intimidated,” Ms. Holmes said after we’d moved on to several other topics. “As I said at trial, I completely wish we’d handled that situation differently.” She tears up. “I take responsibility for it because I was C.E.O. of the company and at the end of the day, that’s that, but I don’t believe in people being treated that way, period.” (In response to Ms. Holmes seemingly casting blame on her legal team, a spokeswoman for Mr. Boies texted, “Whatever.”)</p><p>Ms. Holmes chooses her words carefully when I ask if the prominent men who invested and joined the Theranos board were drawn to the start-up partly because the founder was an attractive young woman. “A lot of people were attracted to this for their own reasons,” she said.</p><p>What does she think would have happened if she hadn’t garnered so much early attention as the second coming of Silicon Valley? Ms. Holmes does not blink: “We would’ve seen through our vision.” In other words, she thinks if she’d spent more time quietly working on her inventions and less time on a stage promoting the company, she would have revolutionized health care by now.</p><p>This kind of misguided talk is the one consistent thread in my reporting on who Ms. Holmes really is. She repeatedly says that Theranos wasn’t a get-rich-quick scheme for her; she never sold her shares and didn’t come out of it wealthy. Ms. Holmes’s parents said they borrowed $500,000 against their Washington, D.C.-area home to post Ms. Holmes’s bond.</p><p>I can’t shake an earlier story that Mr. Evans relayed. In the waning days of Theranos, Ms. Holmes got a dog, a Siberian husky named Balto. Last year, when a mountain lion carried Balto away from the front porch, Ms. Holmes spent 16 hours searching in the woods, digging through brambles and poison oak, hoping to find him alive. Everyone knew Balto was dead, but Ms. Holmes kept searching. The relentlessness. The certainty. The fanaticism. It’s the same way Ms. Holmes kept hanging on at Theranos. </p></div><div data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\"><figure role=\"group\" aria-label=\"media\"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden=\"false\">Ms. Holmes arriving at federal court in San Jose, Calif., for sentencing in November.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden=\"false\">Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Over antioxidant smoothies, Ms. Holmes told me she has ideas for Covid testing, drawing on her work in a Singapore lab as a college student during the SARS outbreak.</p><p>She maintains the idealistic delusion of a 19-year-old, never mind that she’s 39 with a fraud conviction, telling me she is still working on health care-related inventions and would continue to do so behind bars.</p><p>“I still dream about being able to contribute in that space,” Ms. Holmes said. “I still feel the same calling to it as I always did and I still think the need is there.”</p><p>If your head is exploding at how divorced from reality this sounds, that’s kind of the point. When Ms. Holmes uses the messianic vernacular of tech, I get the sense that she truly believes that she could have — and, in fact, she still could — change the world, and she doesn’t much care if we believe her or not. “Liz is not a natural born leader; she is more of a zealot than a showman,” Mr. Evans wrote to Judge Davila.</p></div><div><p>It’s this steadfast (or unhinged?) belief that has kept Ms. Holmes fighting, even though a guilty plea would have likely helped her chances of remaining free. “She could have said, ‘Yes, I lied, and I tried my best to save mankind, but this happened in my enthusiasm,’” her father told me. “But she has taken the position that she is not guilty and that takes guts.” </p><p>Ms. Holmes eventually found her beloved husky, Balto, in the woods. But by then the dog was gone, torn apart by the mountain lion.</p><h2 id=\"link-NaN\">***</h2><p>The last day I spent with Ms. Holmes, I parked and walked up the long driveway to find her and Mr. Evans embracing in the kitchen. They looked like they were slow dancing, swaying slightly, the two of them against the world. Fireplace burning. Seagulls flying overhead. Teddy drooling in his crate. Babies (plural) sleeping.</p><p>Mr. Evans left for a workout, saying he doesn’t want “dad bod.” Ms. Holmes and I sat at the kitchen table alone, talking. She didn’t seem like a hero or a villain. She seemed, like most people, somewhere in between. As Ms. Holmes broke down thinking about what her children will be like in 11 years, I kept going back to her central promise at Theranos: The technology that she invented would, in her words, create “a world in which no one ever has to say goodbye too soon.”</p><p>And there she was, preparing to do just that.</p><p>That Friday, the couple were getting ready to host a group of friends from the Bay Area. They invited me to stay. They repeatedly invited me to come back, to bring my family. We could all go to the zoo together.</p></div><div><p>I appreciated their hospitality, but I didn’t fully understand it. Usually interview subjects can’t wait to get rid of me.</p><p>Then I realized why they kept opening the door wider. Ms. Holmes is unlike anyone I’ve ever met — modest but mesmerizing. If you are in her presence, it is impossible not to believe her, not to be taken with her and be taken in by her. Liz Holmes and Billy Evans know that. I politely declined their invitation.</p><p>Audio produced by Kate Winslett.</p></div></section></article></div>"

			"content": "She Wrote of Grief After Her Husband Died. Now She’s Charged in His Murder. Kouri Richins wrote a children’s book to help her three sons process their father’s sudden death, she said. Prosecutors said this week that she poisoned him with a lethal dose of fentanyl. • None ouri Richins in Park City, Utah, last month. After she published a children’s book entitled “Are You With Me?” about grief, she was charged with murder in the March 2022 death of her husband, Eric.  After Kouri Richins’s husband, Eric, died suddenly last year, she wrote a children’s book that she said she hoped would help her three boys process the loss, comforted by the knowledge that their father would always be with them. On Monday, a little over two months since the book — “Are You With Me?” — was published, Ms. Richins, 33, was charged with murdering her husband by poisoning him with a lethal dose of fentanyl at their home outside Park City, Utah. “Are You With Me?” follows the story of a boy who lost his father but is reminded of his presence. An autopsy and toxicology report determined that Mr. Richins, 39, had five times the lethal dosage of fentanyl in his system, and that the drug was illicit and not medical grade. The medical examiner also concluded that the fentanyl had been ingested orally, according to court documents. Ms. Richins published “Are You With Me?” on March 7, just over a year after her husband’s death. A few weeks later, she appeared on KTVX-TV in Salt Lake City to promote the book, which follows the story of a boy who lost his father but is reminded of his presence. “My kids and I wrote this book on the different emotions and grieving process that we’ve experienced in the last year, hoping it could help other kids deal with this and kind of find happiness someway or another,” Ms. Richins told KTVX. “It’s comforting for them that they’re not living this life alone. Dad is still here, but in a different way.” A detention hearing is set for May 19. A lawyer for Ms. Richins did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to court documents, on the evening of March 3, 2022, Ms. Richins and Mr. Richins were celebrating the closing of a sale on a house that Ms. Richins, a real estate agent, had sold. She made her husband a Moscow mule, a cocktail, in the kitchen around 9 p.m. and brought it to their bedroom, where Mr. Richins drank it in bed. Ms. Richins later told investigators that she went to bed and woke up around 3 a.m., because one of the boys was having a nightmare. When she returned to the couple’s bedroom, Ms. Richins told investigators, she “felt Eric and he was cold to the touch.” She called 911, according to court documents. When Summit County sheriff’s deputies and emergency medical workers arrived, they found Mr. Richins on the floor at the foot of the bed, the court documents said. They attempted lifesaving measures but could not revive him, and he was pronounced dead. Ms. Richins told investigators that she had left her phone plugged in next to her bed when she went to check on her son. But investigators later found that the phone had been locked and unlocked “multiple times” between the time she said she had gone to her son’s bedroom and the 911 call, according to court documents, and that she had sent and received messages during that time. The messages were later deleted, the court documents say. In addition to murder, Ms. Richins was also charged with three counts of possession of a controlled substance, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, with intent to distribute. Also known as GHB, it is a narcolepsy drug that is also used recreationally at dance clubs, and has been referred to as a “date-rape drug.” A search of Ms. Richins’s phone found “several communications” with “an acquaintance” identified in court papers only as C.L. According to court documents, C.L., who has faced multiple drug charges, told investigators that Ms. Richins had reached out to him between December 2021 and February 2022, seeking help getting prescription pain medication for “an investor who had a back injury.” Two weeks after the pain pills were delivered, Ms. Richins contacted C.L. again and said she was looking for “something stronger,” according to the court documents. She asked for “some of the Michael Jackson stuff,” specifying that she was looking for fentanyl. C.L. sold her 15 to 30 fentanyl pills for $900, the court documents say. On Feb. 14, 2022, three days after Ms. Richins had purchased the pills, Mr. Richins became ill after a Valentine’s Day dinner at their home in Kamas, Utah. Mr. Richins later told friends that he thought his wife was trying to poison him, according to court documents. Two weeks later, Ms. Richins contacted C.L. again, asking for another $900 worth of fentanyl pills. C.L. procured the pills from a dealer, the court documents say, and left them for Ms. Richins outside a house she was selling in Midway, Utah, south of Park City. “Six days later,” the court documents said, “Eric was found dead of a fentanyl overdose.”",

The medical examiner also concluded that the fentanyl had been ingested orally, according to court documents.</p></div><div><p>Ms. Richins published “Are You With Me?” on March 7, just over a year after her husband’s death. A few weeks later, <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.abc4.com/gtu/a-childrens-book-to-aid-in-coping-with-grief/\">she appeared on KTVX-TV</a> in Salt Lake City to promote the book, which follows the story of a boy who lost his father but is reminded of his presence.</p><p>“My kids and I wrote this book on the different emotions and grieving process that we’ve experienced in the last year, hoping it could help other kids deal with this and kind of find happiness someway or another,” Ms. Richins told KTVX. “It’s comforting for them that they’re not living this life alone. Dad is still here, but in a different way.”</p><p>A detention hearing is set for May 19. A lawyer for Ms. Richins did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>According to court documents, on the evening of March 3, 2022, Ms. Richins and Mr. Richins were celebrating the closing of a sale on a house that Ms. Richins, a real estate agent, had sold. She made her husband a Moscow mule, a cocktail, in the kitchen around 9 p.m. and brought it to their bedroom, where Mr. Richins drank it in bed.</p><p>Ms. Richins later told investigators that she went to bed and woke up around 3 a.m., because one of the boys was having a nightmare.

But investigators later found that the phone had been locked and unlocked “multiple times” between the time she said she had gone to her son’s bedroom and the 911 call, according to court documents, and that she had sent and received messages during that time. The messages were later deleted, the court documents say.</p><p>In addition to murder, Ms. Richins was also charged with three counts of possession of a controlled substance, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, with intent to distribute. Also known as GHB, it is a narcolepsy drug that is also used recreationally at dance clubs, and has been referred to as a “date-rape drug.”</p><p>A search of Ms. Richins’s phone found “several communications” with “an acquaintance” identified in court papers only as C.L. According to court documents, C.L., who has faced multiple drug charges, told investigators that Ms. Richins had reached out to him between December 2021 and February 2022, seeking help getting prescription pain medication for “an investor who had a back injury.”</p><p>Two weeks after the pain pills were delivered, Ms. Richins contacted C.L. again and said she was looking for “something stronger,” according to the court documents. She asked for “some of the Michael Jackson stuff,” specifying that she was looking for fentanyl. C.L. sold her 15 to 30 fentanyl pills for $900, the court documents say.</p></div><div><p>On Feb. 14, 2022, three days after Ms. Richins had purchased the pills, Mr. Richins became ill after a Valentine’s Day dinner at their home in Kamas, Utah. Mr. Richins later told friends that he thought his wife was trying to poison him, according to court documents.</p><p>Two weeks later, Ms. Richins contacted C.L. again, asking for another $900 worth of fentanyl pills. C.L. procured the pills from a dealer, the court documents say, and left them for Ms. Richins outside a house she was selling in Midway, Utah, south of Park City.</p><p>“Six days later,” the court documents said, “Eric was found dead of a fentanyl overdose.”</p></div></section></article></div>"

			"content": "A glistening, glamorous sparkling celebrity wedding-esque-themed night. A who’s who of Hollywood in a fairytale amalgamation of glitz. Let’s raise a toast to the 2023 Met Gala and begin by taking a trip down memory lane…  Religion, Camp, American a vast array of glorious themes for us fashion writers to get our teeth into.  Firstly, what is the Met Gala? Well, dear reader, this highly anticipated- probably the biggest event in the fashion calendar — is merely a fundraising abut on the grandest scale. It was curated to raise money for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Insitute.  The night is mainly organised by Vouge’s editor-in-chief Miss Anna Wintour and brings together THE celebrities of the moment in one star-studded spectacle. It is known to most fashion lovers, such as myself, as the most important night of the year.  Now I’m going to rewind back to my two favourite Met Galas to prepare you for this year’s analysis.  Nothing, I repeat nothing has ever topped this Met Gala for me. The theme was bewitching and decadent, and the looks are so ingrained within my psyche that I’ll never fully be over it. The key was Miss Kim K herself, who on that evening in question became the Queen of the Met. Kim’s golden perfectly fitted Versace dress and face that was contoured to the gods were of gargantuan cultural significance.  The year was 2018, peak Kardashian time. Kim- Ye were the couple, likes were our currency and the Kardashian-esque street/fitness wear was our obsession. Her look encompassed all this, in a vision of sculpted perfection, this was beauty in the 2010s. And that my friends is the importance of the Gala, it takes the culture and merges it into the world of costume and theatre; its significance is something that should never be underestimated.  In 2019 we moved away from religious crucifixes to the stupendously fun and frolicky world of Camp. My main memory was simply an array of pink mist. It felt light, whimsical and the key players- Lady Gaga and Harry Styles.  Harry wore the most iconic male Met Gala look of all time. The sheer, the simplicity, the earrings, the look ahead of 2019.  Again, the image rests deep within my psyche, as there is something just so gorgeous that it omits. I’m going to use a term here that I’ll come back to a few times in this piece and that is pronounced chic. Now, by this term, I mean strong, vivid, bold but subtle and not overstated. Harry’s look perfectly encompassed these elements, making it so striking it feels like that of a painting.  Gaga. Gaga did what Gaga does best- camp. She didn’t just bring a look, she brought a performance which is a must-watch for any Met-Gala lover.  In it, she plays the part of, let’s just say, Mrs Camp. The lightness, the flicks, the constant look of surprise. The men around her then begin to unveil her, alongside her dear friend and designer Brandon Maxwell. In this fifteen minutes of pure campery, Gaga does not break character once. A small carriage then appears, and everything starts to come off- to which you hear paparazzi say ‘There’s a reveal!’. Then more shock from Gaga, as we see the classic black dress delivered with an umbrella. Can we also take a moment to appreciate the over-exaggerated golden eyelashes- the drama. We then move to the third, what we think is the final layer — A PINK DRESS. More Shock, and Monroe- esk moves to accompany. Next, a telephone touching on her own Gaga-verse, referencing / not referencing…  We then get a whole ensemble performance of Camp and Gaga putting on makeup with the Paparrazi. And the final layer, simply black underwear — the full feminine physique. Altogether, silly, entertaining and perfectly fitting to the theme. Again, perfectly pronounced chic, but with the extra layers of exaggeration, commitment and theatre. All of these elements are what it takes to win the Met Gala.  Now read on, to see who achieve Gaga levels this year…  The theme this year was well… controversial. However, this is a fashion review. I’m not here to get political, I’m here to analyse so here’s my take on the theme.  The theme will be focusing mainly on Karl’s work for Chanel and Fendi. Meaning you need to be going classic and pure, think pearls and tweed. Then within this, there should be elements of how Lagerfeld took the fashion of old and re-invented it to make it contemporary. Take for example a classic Chanel suit but heightening the cut and using more modern colours such as pink and purple- see below.  He loved strong cuts, extreme shoulders and classic colours such as black and white, and not forgetting touches of the gothic. With the incorporation of Chanel, expect many a Chanel Bride, a quintessential statement piece for this brand.  Now Cats. Lagerfeld’s Cat Choupette, was his pride and joy and still to this day lives an exceptionally lavish lifestyle. The incorporation of feline energy will be paramount to this particular Gala. The question is by who?  What I personally would have worn  Cringe, but I don’t care because I love my idea.  So, if I were to have attended (in an alternate universe!) I would have fully gone with the Cat theme but then mixed it with the touches of Karl. All black, with a hood of a Cat going over my head and then a regal body that drapes for miles across the carpet.  Then the signature Chanel tweed weaved in and also a long cat string toy to give it some pizzazz. I’d want my makeup to have subtle hints of white on my eyelashes, and possibly even white lipstick depending on if it worked or not. Giving a black and white glamour cat with all the Lagerfeld touches needed to fully unify this theme.  For my main bulk of Met Gala analysis, I come to you from a coffee shop. I am prepped with my notebook, Chia Iced Tea and ready to give you a humongous deep-dive into the biggest night in fashion.  This was the first Met Gala without the backdrop of Covid, so the air last night (even in my London bedroom) was filled with exhilaration and anticipation. I had the Vouge coverage showing on my TV, and the most recent pap pics refreshing on my laptop, I was ready.  So here are my first notes.  The first element I noticed was the carpet, it wasn’t what I was expecting. I was thinking it was going to be full white but instead, it had a couple of coordinating colours giving vibrancy  White everywhere, a bridal-like theme, thick fabrics, Chloe Finneman’s cat handbag. Lots of little touches such as Nicole Kidman’s bow, and nice nods to Largefeld- very clever. A classical Fairytale vibe in the air. The first few looks were a nice welcome back but I wasn’t wowed yet…  As the night swirled on I really started to get excited.  I jotted down words such as romantic, historic, regal and chic. Mostly, pure Chanel and the feeling that this Met Gala is a giant fairytale celebrity wedding. The footage is vibrant and buzzy, and the are looks and coming in thick and fast.  Now for my winners…  Doja did the cat, and my oh my what a perfect way to bring herself as an artist being a CAT and Karl’s beloved Cat together, with an almost spookily prosthetic face. The bejewelled silver Oscar De Le Renta Gown was distinct but not in your face, the cat face on the other hand you couldn’t miss. How she managed to still look so stunning with the face of a Cat is beyond me. A moment, thank you Doja.  One of this year’s co-chairs and she brought us Hollywood.  What is a co-chair? The Co-Chairs help to create the atmosphere. They select some of the interiors, put together the guest lists and also act as greeters within the event.  Penelope came dressed in a beautiful Chanel sheer gown from Couture Spring / Summer Collection 1988. It gave off a bridal yet regal essence to the nth degree.  My favourite poser of the night, she was confident and self-assured, present and oozed effortless sophistication. One of my most loved looks, more for just her as a person; bringing that old-school 90s Hollywood we so desperately and nostalgically cling to. I adore the dress too, fair and alluring, detailed and was a perfect nod to the classic Chanel Bride.  Not one of my favourite Kim looks, she went with an elegant Schiaparelli bodycon and referenced her pearl look from one of her first photoshoots ‘you’re doing great sweetie’, by covering her body in 50,000 worth of pearls.  The press is saying it's an accident that she referenced the old Kardashian episode. However, this is what you have to understand about the Kardashians- nothing is an accident. Kim knew exactly what she was doing, she was aware that wearing pearls would bring the video back into circulation keeping the Kardashian name at the top of the trending sphere. Job well done.  I like this touch as I adore it when celebrities reference their past. It’s clever, bringing in the easter eggs to create a feeling of mystery and elation.  Kardashian, this year, has moved away from the shock factor. In 2021 she went faceless, and then in 2022, the Monroe dress caused a huge backlash. In 2023, Kim has taken more of a backseat with a subtler approach. Still a lovely look, but I hope next year we go back to something a bit more risque…  I wasn’t too sure how this was a reference to Karl, but I adored the pure drama of it. Nas turned up sprayed head to toe in silver, donning a matching thong and not forgetting the Swarovski crystals. Altogether bamboozling and bedazzling; he created astonishment and humour, and I loved the skipping up and down the carpet. I’m a fan.  A celebrity like Lil Nas X is destined for Met Gala greatness, he has the silliness and courageousness to go far. His last few looks have served, and with this kind of portfolio, I expect his next Gala to be more elevated and go to the next level.  A sentimental moment. Nicole sported her iconic 2004 Chanel No. 5 dress. Ultimate Chanel, and a perfect gesture to Karl. The actress looked incredible, of course. My one note would be that I needed more from the hair. She had it down, and it was understatedly chic, BUT for this Met Gala which is an all-encompassing celebration of Chanel, just down isn’t enough. Chanel is all about sophistication and Cosmopolitan, her idea here was to contrast. Yet, Karl wasn’t about messiness, think more about rigidity. The hair needed something extra, although I did enjoy the bow.  As a side note, let’s discuss the 2004 Chanel advert. This era was a truly marvellous time for the Perfume ad, Chanel being the crowning jewel. You see Nicole run through the streets of New York, with her stunning dress flowing onto Time Square street and her lover staring out of a shining C, then Nicole is seen performing the classic starlet turn on the red carpet solidifying her as THE movie star of the 2000s. I’m gushing at this point, but my oh my do I love this advert.  Scratching my ‘Funny Met Gala Look’ itch, our second Choupette, and pure feline. I loved it, this will be an image that sticks when I think of this Met Gala, altogether fun, taking the theme and pushing it to the complete max.  Leto wanted to fully commit to being a cat, and the designers came through. One of the biggest shocks of the night, this costume was kept top secret. He didn’t want anyone to know that the Cat was him until the last minute, which he brilliantly achieved. Jared brought the mystery and astonishment that we oh so crave.  The Princess of Geornovia gave that Versace sensuality and perfectly pronounced chic, fitting the brief while bringing those gorgeous cuts that only my favourite brand can pull off. A hot favourite of the night; a demure, dramatic and momentous Versace look. Also, can we mention the Brigitte Bardot hair, giving a European goddess mystique- magnificent.  Andrea must have taken all that Miranda Priestly wisdom, as Hathaway has made a fashion comeback in the past couple of years. Her recent serves are carefully curated, bang on the trends and effervescently unique, probably the reason Versace picked her as their new IT girl. Did I mention they’re my favourite…  Come through Gucci- my favourite look of the night! Bringing The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.  The Gucci girl. Glamorous, Powerful, Feminine, Blonde and Hollywood. Just everything. Giving the theme of Karl Lagerfeld with his mysterious and intimidating demeanour, and putting it into the female form- genius.  Crystal clear and fitting of the theme. THE fashion girl, touching on the likes of Donatella Versace- the glasses! Jessica, like Gaga, committed to her role. Another must if you’re going to be a winner in the Met Gala, really and I mean REALLY play the part. Jessica, being the talented actress that she is, was devoted and masterful in bringing this 15-minute part to life.  Another key component in order to win at the Met is to debut something brand new. We’re used to this actress with her vibrant red locks, and here she introduced us to Blonde Jessica- a lady not to be messed with!  The trends present at this Gala include Icy White, Gothic Chic, Historic References and the Modern-Day Fairytale. I predict a romantic shift in fashion, with more classical feminine pieces making their way into the summer zeitgeist and classical gothic black/ whites, looping back to our Winter trends. I’m thinking much white, block colours, and dresses. Think snowy to contrast the hotter months.  I’m also envisioning the return of the 2017 icy white hair, or what is becoming known as Barbie Blonde, moving away from balayage. Think vivid.  A lovely well-rounded Met Gala, however not topping 2018/19 for me- but hey maybe that’s just my nostalgia.  The looks were striking, romantic and bold. We’re back to the full Gala glory and it’s tremendously exciting. I thoroughly enjoyed, and wow there were some stand-outs. Although, in my opinion, the celebs could have been even more risque, I wanted more memes and drama. Yet the stage has been set, mark my words next year the looks will be elevated further and maybe even back to the heights of 2018.",

I am prepped with my notebook, Chia Iced Tea and ready to give you a humongous deep-dive into the biggest night in fashion.</em></p><p id=\"df49\">This was the first Met Gala without the backdrop of Covid, so the air last night (even in my London bedroom) was filled with exhilaration and anticipation. I had the Vouge coverage showing on my TV, and the most recent pap pics refreshing on my laptop, I was ready.</p><h2 id=\"730c\">First Reaction</h2><p id=\"7b36\"><em>So here are my first notes.</em></p><p id=\"44de\">The first element I noticed was the carpet, it wasn’t what I was expecting. I was thinking it was going to be full white but instead, it had a couple of coordinating colours giving vibrancy</p><p id=\"9b0f\">White everywhere, a bridal-like theme, thick fabrics, Chloe Finneman’s cat handbag. Lots of little touches such as Nicole Kidman’s bow, and nice nods to Largefeld- very clever. A classical Fairytale vibe in the air. The first few looks were a nice welcome back but I wasn’t wowed yet…</p><h2 id=\"aafb\">Second Reaction</h2><p id=\"e13c\"><em>As the night swirled on I really started to get excited.</em></p><p id=\"89ff\">I jotted down words such as romantic, historic, regal and chic. Mostly, pure Chanel and the feeling that this Met Gala is a giant fairytale celebrity wedding. The footage is vibrant and buzzy, and the are looks and coming in thick and fast.</p><p id=\"3461\">Now for my winners…</p><h2 id=\"df03\">The Winners</h2><p id=\"3a18\"><strong>Doja Cat</strong></p><p id=\"e657\">Doja did the cat, and my oh my what a perfect way to bring herself as an artist being a CAT and Karl’s beloved Cat together, with an almost spookily prosthetic face. The bejewelled silver Oscar De Le Renta Gown was distinct but not in your face, the cat face on the other hand you couldn’t miss. How she managed to still look so stunning with the face of a Cat is beyond me. A moment, thank you Doja.</p><p id=\"a58a\"><strong>Penelope Cruz</strong></p><p id=\"c996\">One of this year’s co-chairs and she brought us Hollywood.</p><p id=\"f13c\"><em>What is a co-chair? The Co-Chairs help to create the atmosphere. They select some of the interiors, put together the guest lists and also act as greeters within the event.</em></p><p id=\"9c52\">Penelope came dressed in a beautiful Chanel sheer gown from Couture Spring / Summer Collection 1988. It gave off a bridal yet regal essence to the nth degree.</p><p id=\"1904\">My favourite poser of the night, she was confident and self-assured, present and oozed effortless sophistication. One of my most loved looks, more for just her as a person; bringing that old-school 90s Hollywood we so desperately and nostalgically cling to. I adore the dress too, fair and alluring, detailed and was a perfect nod to the classic Chanel Bride.</p><p id=\"cde5\"><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></p><p id=\"2e38\">Not one of my favourite Kim looks, she went with an elegant Schiaparelli bodycon and referenced her pearl look from one of her first photoshoots <em>‘you’re doing great sweetie’</em>, by covering her body in 50,000 worth of pearls.</p><p id=\"eae1\">The press is saying it's an accident that she referenced the old Kardashian episode. However, this is what you have to understand about the Kardashians- nothing is an accident. Kim knew exactly what she was doing, she was aware that wearing pearls would bring the video back into circulation keeping the Kardashian name at the top of the trending sphere. Job well done.</p><p id=\"947a\">I like this touch as I adore it when celebrities reference their past. It’s clever, bringing in the easter eggs to create a feeling of mystery and elation.</p><figure></figure><p id=\"74d8\">Kardashian, this year, has moved away from the shock factor. In 2021 she went faceless, and then in 2022, the Monroe dress caused a huge backlash. In 2023, Kim has taken more of a backseat with a subtler approach. Still a lovely look, but I hope next year we go back to something a bit more risque…</p><p id=\"88bd\"><strong>Lil Nas X</strong></p><p id=\"3272\">I wasn’t too sure how this was a reference to Karl, but I adored the pure drama of it. Nas turned up sprayed head to toe in silver, donning a matching thong and not forgetting the Swarovski crystals. Altogether bamboozling and bedazzling; he created astonishment and humour, and I loved the skipping up and down the carpet. I’m a fan.</p><p id=\"3d8a\">A celebrity like Lil Nas X is destined for Met Gala greatness, he has the silliness and courageousness to go far. His last few looks have served, and with this kind of portfolio, I expect his next Gala to be more elevated and go to the next level.</p><p id=\"7c7f\"><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></p><p id=\"b99e\">A sentimental moment. Nicole sported her iconic 2004 Chanel No. 5 dress. Ultimate Chanel, and a perfect gesture to Karl. The actress looked incredible, of course. My one note would be that I needed more from the hair. She had it down, and it was understatedly chic, BUT for this Met Gala which is an all-encompassing celebration of Chanel, just down isn’t enough. Chanel is all about sophistication and Cosmopolitan, her idea here was to contrast. Yet, Karl wasn’t about messiness, think more about rigidity. The hair needed something extra, although I did enjoy the bow.</p><p id=\"d68a\">As a side note, let’s discuss the 2004 Chanel advert. This era was a truly marvellous time for the Perfume ad, Chanel being the crowning jewel. You see Nicole run through the streets of New York, with her stunning dress flowing onto Time Square street and her lover staring out of a shining C, then Nicole is seen performing the classic starlet turn on the red carpet solidifying her as THE movie star of the 2000s. I’m gushing at this point, but my oh my do I love this advert.</p><figure></figure><p id=\"8f91\"><strong>Jared Leto</strong></p><p id=\"398b\">Scratching my ‘Funny Met Gala Look’ itch, our second Choupette, and pure feline. I loved it, this will be an image that sticks when I think of this Met Gala, altogether fun, taking the theme and pushing it to the complete max.</p><p id=\"4f3f\">Leto wanted to fully commit to being a cat, and the designers came through. One of the biggest shocks of the night, this costume was kept top secret. He didn’t want anyone to know that the Cat was him until the last minute, which he brilliantly achieved. Jared brought the mystery and astonishment that we oh so crave.</p><p id=\"da77\"><strong>Anne Hathaway</strong></p><p id=\"f93e\">The Princess of Geornovia gave that Versace sensuality and perfectly pronounced chic, fitting the brief while bringing those gorgeous cuts that only my favourite brand can pull off. A hot favourite of the night; a demure, dramatic and momentous Versace look. Also, can we mention the Brigitte Bardot hair, giving a European goddess mystique- magnificent.</p><p id=\"69c5\">Andrea must have taken all that Miranda Priestly wisdom, as Hathaway has made a fashion comeback in the past couple of years. Her recent serves are carefully curated, bang on the trends and effervescently unique, probably the reason Versace picked her as their new IT girl. Did I mention they’re my favourite…</p><p id=\"c165\"><strong>Jessica Chastain</strong></p><p id=\"09ed\">Come through Gucci- my favourite look of the night! Bringing The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.</p><p id=\"d1ff\">The Gucci girl. Glamorous, Powerful, Feminine, Blonde and Hollywood. Just everything. Giving the theme of Karl Lagerfeld with his mysterious and intimidating demeanour, and putting it into the female form- genius.</p><p id=\"f153\">Crystal clear and fitting of the theme. THE fashion girl, touching on the likes of Donatella Versace- the glasses! Jessica, like Gaga, committed to her role. Another must if you’re going to be a winner in the Met Gala, really and I mean REALLY play the part. Jessica, being the talented actress that she is, was devoted and masterful in bringing this 15-minute part to life.</p><figure></figure><p id=\"cab7\">Another key component in order to win at the Met is to debut something brand new. We’re used to this actress with her vibrant red locks, and here she introduced us to Blonde Jessica- a lady not to be messed with!</p><h2 id=\"3a90\">The Trends</h2><p id=\"ae9b\"><em>Icy Whites, Romance and the BOLD.</em></p><p id=\"9e05\">The trends present at this Gala include Icy White, Gothic Chic, Historic References and the Modern-Day Fairytale. I predict a romantic shift in fashion, with more classical feminine pieces making their way into the summer zeitgeist and classical gothic black/ whites, looping back to our Winter trends. I’m thinking much white, block colours, and dresses. Think snowy to contrast the hotter months.</p><p id=\"578c\">I’m also envisioning the return of the 2017 icy white hair, or what is becoming known as Barbie Blonde, moving away from balayage. Think vivid.</p><h2 id=\"648b\">The Final Round-Up</h2><p id=\"49f3\"><em>A lovely well-rounded Met Gala, however not topping 2018/19 for me- but hey maybe that’s just my nostalgia.</em></p><p id=\"02da\">The looks were striking, romantic and bold. We’re back to the full Gala glory and it’s tremendously exciting. I thoroughly enjoyed, and wow there were some stand-outs. Although, in my opinion, the celebs could have been even more risque, I wanted more memes and drama. Yet the stage has been set, mark my words next year the looks will be elevated further and maybe even back to the heights of 2018.</p></div></div>"

			"content": "In today’s digital landscape, personal data has emerged as a highly valuable commodity. Companies and organizations collect an increasing amount of data about individuals, well aware of data’s revolutionary potential to overhaul business performance. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that data and analytics could create value worth between $9.5 trillion and $15.4 trillion a year — provided its value is properly harnessed.  However, while the benefits of this data can be significant, the risks to individuals’ privacy and security are equally concerning. In this blog post we explore how Web3 is changing data privacy and why decentralized identities are critical for protecting personal information in the decentralized web. We’ll also look at some of the challenges and opportunities facing Web3 and decentralized identities and what this means for the future of online privacy.  2. The Rise of Data: Opportunities and Challenges  The potential benefits of a full-scale data economy are immense. It has the power to transform industries, drive innovation, and create new opportunities for businesses and individuals alike. In line with this, the adoption of data analytics has been on the rise across industries, with businesses leveraging large amounts of data to improve decision-making, enhance customer experiences, and gain a competitive edge. According to a recent report by the International Data Corporation (IDC), the global datasphere is projected to reach 175 zettabytes by 2025, with an annual growth rate of 61%. This represents a massive opportunity for businesses to harness the power of data and transform their operations.  In the finance industry, data is being leveraged to assess credit risk, detect fraud, and optimize trading strategies. In healthcare, clinical decision-making, disease management, and population health management are made easier with data. Additionally, with the global artificial intelligence market size valued at USD 136.55 billion and gaining steady adoption, data is relied upon to train its algorithms and make accurate predictions. The more data that is available, the better businesses can become at identifying consumer patterns, making predictions, and providing insights to fuel strategic decisions.  However, pressing challenges need to be mitigated to realize a full-scale adoption of the data economy. Along with the lack of standardization in data collection and management, there remain pertinent concerns around data privacy and security, with businesses needing to ensure they are complying with regulatory requirements and protecting sensitive data from cyber threats. According to a report by IBM, the average cost of a data breach in 2020 was $3.86 million which also revealed that organizations lose an estimated 5% of their annual revenues to data related fraud.  The need of the hour therefore, becomes adoption of technologies that allow for the implementation of robust security measures, ensure complete user control and eliminate the need for centralized data repositories that are vulnerable to cyber attacks. That’s where Web3 comes in.  3. Web3 and Better Data Management: Why is it the obvious solution?  Blockchain technology has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing concerns around data privacy and security. By giving users more control and creating a more decentralized and transparent system, these technologies have the potential to create a more secure and equitable data economy. Unlike traditional centralized systems like leading social media applications, data storage services like iCloud, banks etc where data is vulnerable to cyber attacks and breaches, decentralizing data storage is a step in the right direction towards ensuring privacy and security. The use of cryptographic algorithms and digital signatures with decentralized storages like IPFS, Storj etc can ensure that only authorized parties can access or modify the data.  Providing an immutable and tamper-proof record of all data transactions, blockchain technology helps ensure the security and integrity of the data which makes it a solution for sensitive data such as financial information, personal health records, and identity information.  4. What is the need for Decentralized Digital Identities?  Data sharing protocols are popular and offer numerous benefits that can present some privacy and security risks for users. There is a risk of data breaches or hacks that could compromise sensitive user information and affect users’ trust in the platform. Furthermore, because these protocols are decentralized, they may face difficulties in complying with regulations, which can increase risks associated with data sharing. To address these challenges and enhance security, it is crucial to incorporate an identity layer such as DIDs (Decentralised Digital Identities).  The benefits of implementing decentralized identity across data sharing platforms are many:  4.1 Security: DIDs provide a secure way for users to authenticate themselves and control their digital identity. By leveraging cryptography, decentralized identities offer cryptographic guarantees that prevent unauthorized access to user data, and enable users to control how their data is shared across different applications and services. This can help to reduce data breaches and hacking attacks, which are a major concern in the centralized digital identity management systems that currently dominate the web.  4.2 Privacy: DIDs as part of a larger decentralized digital identity stack, enable users to maintain greater privacy and anonymity online, by allowing them to choose what information they share with different services and applications. This is in contrast to traditional centralized identity management systems, which often require users to provide a lot of personal information in order to use the service. By using decentralized identities, users can choose to reveal only the information that is necessary for a particular interaction, rather than sharing their entire identity and personal information.  4.3 Interoperability: Decentralized identity systems can help to enable interoperability between different Web3 applications and services, by providing a standard way for users to authenticate themselves and control their data across different platforms. This can help to reduce the need for users to create multiple accounts and manage different sets of login credentials, which can be a frustrating and time-consuming experience. By using decentralized identities, users can maintain a consistent digital identity across different Web3 services, which can help to streamline the user experience and promote greater adoption of decentralized applications and services.  Suppose there is a DAO that mandates DIDs to ensure that each member has only one vote. Users that are members of that DAO may have accounts on several different blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Each account has a different address, but they are all linked to the user’s DID.  When the user wants to vote on a proposal in the DAO, they first need to authenticate themselves using their DID. The DAO then verifies the identity and confirms that they only have 1 vote. This ensures that no user cannot use multiple addresses to gain an unfair advantage over other members.  At the same time, DIDs also help protect the privacy of DAO members. Because their identity is linked to a DID, rather than their individual addresses, it is much harder for anyone to track their activity on different blockchain networks. This helps ensure that data remains private and secure. In this way, DIDs make it easier for DAOs to operate fairly and transparently, while also protecting the privacy of their members.  Founded in 2017, Fractal is the leading provider of identity solutions for Web3, with nearly one million users distributed across more than 200 Web3 projects. Fractal is currently engaged in building an all-encompassing identity stack that works for everyone, everywhere . Fractal is dedicated to extending support to dApps by fulfilling their specific identity requirements, ranging from complying with data and regulatory standards, including GDPR regulations, to facilitating seamless user verification via the use of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, alongside human liveliness checks.  The increase in regulatory scrutiny around data sharing protocols calls for proper Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance and identity verification solutions. Such measures ensure the establishment of trust and efficiency in data sharing transactions, thus maximizing the benefits of the data economy.  Fractal offers identity solutions tailored to address various needs, including Sybil resistance for establishing human uniqueness and KYC/AML compliance to meet regulatory requirements. The identity integration options are customized to cater to the specific requirements of different Web3 projects, ranging from conventional OAuth to decentralized identity solutions such as the DID Registry.

			"content": "Memecoins have been making waves in crypto for the past month now, with many people jumping on board to get a piece of the action. While $PEPE is the most well-known memecoin during this memerun, there were many other projects that gained popularity and many that failed to do so. But $MTRAIN is a complete game changer in the world of memecoins as it is designed to constantly increase in value.  What is $MTRAIN and how does it work?  Moon Train has a unique system that is designed to maintain a trend of decreasing the amount of $MTRAIN in the pool, thereby increasing its value. With every trade, the contract tracks the amount of $MTRAIN in the pool to maintain its level within a specified range. This means that the market cap of $MTRAIN will be constantly increasing, and you won’t be able to sell your $MTRAIN at a loss.  WHEN BUYING   The number of $MTRAIN that you buy and the purchase price is recorded. There is NO buy tax! WHEN SELLING (Protection mechanism)  If the current number of ETH in the pool is 3% or higher than it was at the time of token purchase and if your sale does not reduce the number of ETH in the pool by 3% or more, the trade will be executed smoothly (protection against whales and MEV bots). If the conditions are not met, the trade will be prohibited.  To better understand how $MTRAIN’s unique system works, let’s take a closer look at an example. Imagine that the initial supply of $MTRAIN is 1,000,000 tokens, and the price of each token is 0.0001 ETH. This means that the initial market cap of $MTRAIN is 100 ETH.  Let’s take a closer look at the 3% sale protection mechanism. Imagine you swapped 10,000 $MTRAIN tokens for 1 ETH at a rate of 0.0001 ETH per token a few hours ago. Now, suppose the pool has grown to 150 ETH, which is a 50% increase from the time of your swap. If you want to swap your 10,000 $MTRAIN tokens back to ETH, the system will verify whether the current number of ETH in the pool is at least 3% higher than it was at the time of your initial swap. Since the pool has increased by at least 3%, this means that you can swap your tokens at the current market price of 0.00015 ETH per token, which is 50% higher than the initial price, and receive 1.5 ETH for your tokens. This illustrates how the constant growth system and the 3% sale protection mechanism work together to safeguard investors and drive the growth of $MTRAIN’s market cap over time.  As previously mentioned, the $MTRAIN system is intended to guarantee a continuous reduction in the number of tokens available in the pool, leading to a gradual increase in token scarcity over time. Moreover, the 1% burn mechanism from every sale is added to make growth even more sustainable by further decreasing the supply of $MTRAIN tokens, making them even scarcer.  Currently, we are stress-testing the Moon Train model on L2 with transactions to see how it performs during simulated sales, purchases, and even potential bot manipulations.  Overall, the constant growth system, burning mechanism, and 3% sale protection mechanism all work together to help stimulate demand for $MTRAIN and create a sustainable market cap growth trend.  It is important to understand that in the world of memecoins, price fluctuations can be heavily influenced by various factors such as community sentiment, FUD, speculation, and even blatant manipulation. As a result, 99% of memecoins fail to gain traction and those that do often experience rapid growth (999%), but sooner or later, it is followed by a significant crash (1000%).  Our $MTRAIN token is designed to protect against sudden price drops, but it is important to note that constant growth is necessary to maintain its value. Those who purchase at a higher price may need to put in more effort into social engagement to help the project bring more exposure.  The concept is designed to support rapid growth in the early stages of the project. As the liquidity pool grows, the sale protection mechanism will gradually be disabled entirely. To protect investors from potential losses in the event of growth being stalled or slowed down, we have also implemented additional security measures(built into the contract) where the sale protection mechanism will be automatically disabled 90 days after deploying the contract.  Numerous tests with liquidity pools starting from different volumes of $ETH have shown that the optimal and most stable uptrend, with the best dynamics, is achieved on a pool of 10 $ETH (Navy Blue graph).  Similarly, the contract will be renounced and the blockchain hash of the transaction will be provided as proof. This will remove any access the team has to the contract and provide an additional layer of security for investors.  The launch of Moon Train is imminent, with an expected launch within the next 48 hours.

			"content": "Assuming you knew about chatbots or man-made reasoning, you’ve likely known about ChatGPT, a high-level language model made by OpenAI in view of GPT-3.5 engineering. In this article, we’ll dig into the rudiments of ChatGPT and examine the reason why it’s become a particularly famous device in the realm of innovation.  In response to a prompt or query, ChatGPT is a language model that produces writing that appears human. It is built on a deep neural network that has been trained on a sizable corpus of text to anticipate the chance of various words and phrases appearing in a specific situation. As a result, ChatGPT can produce language that is logical and sounds natural even when it is given instructions or topics that are foreign to it.  OpenAI, a research organization specializing in the creation of cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology, developed ChatGPT. Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Greg Brockman, along with other tech heavyweights, created the firm in 2015, and it has since grown to be one of the most renowned and significant figures in the AI sector.  ChatGPT works by utilizing a cycle called natural language processing (NLP). It separates text into little units called tokens and uses a deep neural network to predict the likelihood of each token given the context. The neural network is trained on a large dataset of text, which helps it learn patterns and recognize common features of the language. When presented with a prompt or question, ChatGPT generates a sequence of tokens that make sense in the given context.  For instance, assuming that you ask ChatGPT “What are the weather conditions like today?”, the model could produce a reaction like “The present weather conditions are bright and warm.” It does this by examining the words in the brief, perceiving that you’re getting some information about the climate, and utilizing its insight into meteorology and jargon to create a suitable response.  Try it for free here, http://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/  ChatGPT depends on the Transformer design, which was presented in a paper by Vaswani et al. in 2017. This design reformed the field of regular language handling by presenting an original self-consideration component that permitted the model to take care of various pieces of the info grouping simultaneously.  The Transformer architecture has two main components: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder takes the input sequence and transforms it into a sequence of hidden states, which represent the input information. The decoder takes these hidden states and generates the output sequence, which could be a translation, summary, or answer to a question.  Fun fact 😄: ChatGPT can write poetry, stories, and even jokes! It has a creative side that can produce entertaining and engaging content.  Thank you for taking the time to read this article.

			"content": "Japan is in talks to open a NATO liaison office, the first of its kind in Asia, the country’s foreign minister told CNN in an exclusive interview on Wednesday, saying Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made the world less stable.  “We are already in discussions, but no details (have been) finalized yet,” Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Wednesday.  Hayashi specifically cited Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year as an event with repercussions far beyond Europe’s borders that forced Japan to rethink regional security.  “The reason why we are discussing about this is that since the aggression by Russia to Ukraine, the world (has) become more unstable,” he said.  “Something happening in East Europe is not only confined to the issue in East Europe, and that affects directly the situation here in the Pacific. That’s why a cooperation between us in East Asia and NATO (is) becoming … increasingly important.”  He added that Japan is not a treaty member of NATO, which stands for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization – but that the move sends a message the bloc’s Asia Pacific partners are “engaging in a very steady manner” with NATO.  The opening of a NATO liaison office in Japan would mark a significant development for the Western alliance amid deepening geopolitical fault lines, and is likely to attract criticism from the Chinese government, which has previously warned against such a move.  The Nikkei Asia first reported plans to open the office in Japan last Wednesday, citing unnamed Japanese and NATO officials.  NATO has similar liaison offices in other places including Ukraine and Vienna. The liaison office in Japan will enable discussions with NATO’s security partners, such as South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, on geopolitical challenges, emerging and disruptive technologies, and cyber threats, Nikkei reported last week.  In a statement to CNN last week, a NATO spokesperson said: “As to plans to open a liaison office in Japan, we won’t go into the details of ongoing deliberations among NATO allies.” She added that NATO and Japan “have a long-standing cooperation.”  CNN reached out to NATO for comment on Wednesday after Hayashi’s remarks.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves through Europe and drove non-aligned Finland and Sweden to abandon their neutrality and seek protection within NATO, with Finland formally joining the bloc last month.  The war has also seen countries like Japan and South Korea draw closer to their Western partners, while presenting a united front against perceived threats closer to home.  Speaking to CNN on Wednesday, Hayashi highlighted what he described as Japan’s “severe and complex” regional security environment, noting that in addition to increased Russian aggression, Tokyo is also contending with a nuclear-armed North Korea and a rising China.  China has been growing its naval and air forces in areas near Japan while claiming the Senkaku Islands, an uninhabited Japanese-controlled chain in the East China Sea, as its sovereign territory. In the face of growing friction, Japan recently announced plans for its biggest military buildup since World War II.  Tensions between Japan and Russia have also been increasing in recent months, fueled in part by Russian military drills in the waters between the two nations, and joint Chinese-Russian naval patrols in the western Pacific close to Japan.  In April, Russian warships conducted anti-submarine exercises in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea – and in March, Russian missile boats fired cruise missiles at a mock target in the same waters. And after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida made a surprise visit to Ukraine in March, two Russian strategic bombers, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, flew over waters off the Japanese coast for more than seven hours, Reuters reported.  Despite the growing regional tensions, Hayashi said the potential opening of the office was not aimed at specific countries. “This is not intended…to be sending a message,” said Hayashi.  China has previously warned against NATO expanding its reach into Asia and responded angrily to previous reports on the possible Japan office.  “Asia is a promising land for cooperation and a hotbed for peaceful development. It should not be a platform for those who seek geopolitical fights,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning in a briefing last week. “NATO’s eastward push and interference in Asia Pacific matters will definitely undermine regional peace and stability.”  Though Beijing has claimed impartiality in the Ukraine war and no advance knowledge of Russia’s intent, it has refused to condemn Moscow’s actions. Instead, it has parroted Kremlin lines blaming NATO for provoking the conflict – further fracturing relationships with both Europe and the US.  And in March, senior Chinese Foreign Ministry officials and influential Communist Party publications accused the United States of seeking to build a NATO-like bloc in the Indo-Pacific, with one official warning of “unimaginable” consequences.  On Wednesday, Hayashi played down concerns that opening a Tokyo NATO office could further inflame tensions, saying: “I don’t feel that’s the case.”  The country has had a pacifist constitution since World War II – which he argued is reflected in this move.  “We are not offending anyone, we’re defending ourselves from any kind of interference and concerns, and in some cases threats,” he said.",

Trump denied all wrongdoing. He does not face any jail time as a result of the civil verdict.  While the jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, the jury did not find that Carroll proved he raped her.  Carroll filed the lawsuit last November under the “New York State Adult Survivors Act,” a state bill which opened a look-back window for sexual assault allegations like Carroll’s with long-expired statutes of limitation.  Trump did not attend the trial. Like any defendant in a civil case, he was not required to appear in court for trial or any proceedings and has a right not to testify in his own defense.  Carroll called the verdict a victory for her and other victims of abuse.  “I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back,” she said in a statement. “Today, the world finally knows the truth. This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.”  Carroll’s lead attorney, Roberta Kaplan also released a statement saying, “No one is above the law, not even a former President of the United States.”  In videos posted to his social media platform Truth Social Tuesday evening, Trump said he plans to appeal the verdict, calling it a “disgrace” and “political witch hunt.” He also repeated his claim he did not know who Carroll was.  Trump attorney Joe Tacopina outside the court Tuesday said that he had spoken to the former president and that he is “ready to proceed and go forward.”  “He’s firm in his belief, as many people are, that he cannot get a fair trial in New York City based on the jury pool,” Tacopina said.  Tacopina called the verdict “strange,” emphasizing that the jury had not found Trump liable for rape.  “This was a rape claim. This was rape case all along and the jury rejected that, but made other findings,” he said. “But they rejected her rape claim and she’d always claimed this was a rape case so it’s a little perplexing, but we move forward.”  The verdict comes as the 2024 Republican presidential primary field takes shape, with Trump as the early frontrunner.  His potential rivals, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have so far criticized Trump on electability grounds but have stayed away from the former president’s legal troubles – including Carroll’s allegations and the Manhattan probe into a hush money scheme.  That reluctance to attack Trump over allegations stems from his ability to survive scandals that would have doomed most politicians – including the 2016 release of the “Access Hollywood” tape, in which he bragged that stars can “do anything” to women. Tacopina asserted after the verdict that the tape shouldn’t have been allowed as evidence, saying “We’re very confident on the appellate issues here.”  But as his legal troubles mount, with probes in New York, Washington, DC, and Georgia still underway and primary debates set to begin in August, Trump’s goodwill with GOP voters will again be tested in the coming months.  Jurors urged not to identify themselves  Judge Lewis Kaplan (no relation to attorney Roberta Kaplan) dismissed the jury after the verdict and informed them they are now allowed to identify themselves publicly if they choose. However, the judge suggested they remain silent.  “My advice to you is not to identify yourselves. Not now and not for a long time,”Lewis Kaplan said. “If you’re one who elects to speak to others and to identify yourselves to others, I direct you not to identify anyone else who sat on this jury. Each of you owes that to the other whatever you decided for yourself.”  As the verdict was read, Carroll held onto the hand of her attorney Shawn Crowley. She looked relieved and appeared to rock forward. They exchanged smiles with each other as the clerk read through each of the counts going in her favor.  After the judge dismissed the jury, Trump attorney Tacopina walked over to Carroll and shook her hand. He also shook the hands of her attorneys.  Carroll and her lead attorney Roberta Kaplan embraced each other’s shoulders. They exited together.  On the stand last week, Carroll testifying in chilling detail about what happened in 1996.  “I’m here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn’t happen,” Carroll testified. “He lied and shattered my reputation, and I’m here to try to get my life back.”  Carroll acknowledged she is a registered Democrat and thinks Trump is “evil” and “vile” and was a terrible president, but testified that her political views have nothing to do with her pursuit of this lawsuit.  “I’m not settling a political score,” Carroll said. “I’m settling a personal score because he called me a liar repeatedly and it really has decimated my reputation. I’m a journalist – the one thing I have to have is the trust of the readers.”  Carroll’s attorney Michael Ferrara asked why she didn’t go public with her allegations when Trump first ran for president.  “I noticed that the more women who came forward to accuse him, the better he did in the polls,” she said.  Tacopina, in cross examination, repeatedly asked questions about why Carroll did not scream during the approximately 3-minute alleged attack  “I’m not a screamer,” Carroll responded. “I was too much in panic to scream.”  “You can’t beat up on me for not screaming,” she told the defense lawyer. “Women who don’t come forward, one of the reasons they don’t come forward is they are asked why they didn’t scream. Some women scream, some women don’t. It keeps women silent.”  In his closing argument Monday, Tacopina said he knows Trump is a divisive figure, but that shouldn’t matter to jurors when reaching a verdict.  “People have very strong feelings about Donald Trump. That’s obvious,” Tacopina said. “There’s a time and a secret place to do that: it’s called a ballot box during an election.”  “What they want is for you to hate him enough to ignore the facts,” Tacopina added. “All objective evidence cuts against her.”  Jury did not find that Carroll proved rape  While the jury did not find that Carroll had proven rape, it did find that she proved Trump committed sexual abuse.  The jury had been instructed that a person is liable for sexual abuse when they another person to sexual contact without consent.  Under New York law, “sexual contact” means “any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party.”  The state’s law says that a person is liable for rape when a person forces sexual intercourse with another person without their consent. For the purposes of this law, “sexual intercourse” means “any penetration, however slight, of the penis into the vaginal opening.”  Both sexual abuse and rape are sexual offenses in New York.  The verdict not have any legal effect on Trump’s presidential candidacy. For one, it is a civil case, and during the 2016 campaign Trump also faced all sorts of civil action – like the fraud cases concerning Trump University that were settled shortly after he was elected – that had no bearing on the requirements for the presidency that are laid out in the Constitution.  Trump also faces unrelated criminal exposure, most prominently in the case that Manhattan prosecutors have brought against him for hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who claimed they two had an extramarital affair (Trump denies the claim).  At the same time, a successful criminal prosecution of the former president is unlikely to affect – at least from a legal standpoint – his ability to be reelected to the White House.  Notably, there is precedent for convicted felons to run for federal office – including for the office of the presidency. Eugene V. Debs, a perennial socialist candidate for the White House in the early 20th century, was incarcerated on an espionage conviction when he won more than 900,000 votes in a 1920 presidential campaign.

			"content": "Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan is expected to appear in front of a judge Wednesday on multiple corruption charges, less than 24 hours after he was dramatically arrested by paramilitary troops in a significant escalation of a year-long political standoff that has put the South Asian country on edge.  Khan supporters and riot police gathered outside police headquarters Wednesday, where police said the fomer prime minister’s hearing will take place rather than a court to “keep him away from the public.” Khan’s lawyer Faisal Chaudhry told CNN Wednesday he has had “no contact” with his client.  The stage is now set for the possibility of a tumultuous showdown between the country’s powerful military and Khan’s supporters following deadly and unprecedented clashes Tuesday that saw angry crowds break into and vandalize the homes of army personnel.  Video before Khan’s arrest on Tuesday show paramilitary forces breaking a window to get to the politician as he watched impassively at the unfolding chaos. Khan was then led into a vehicle surrounded by dozens of security officers and escorted away.  In a pre-recorded statement released on YouTube by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) political party after his arrest, the former prime minister said he was “detained on incorrect charges” and told his supporters “the time has come for all of you to come and struggle for your rights.”  “I have always followed the law. I am being apprehended so that I can’t follow my political path for this country’s fundamental rights and for me to obey this corrupt government of crooks which has been hoisted on us,” he said in the video.  Hundreds of Khan supporters responded to his call to take to the streets and violent protests broke out in several cities.  Khan supporters armed with sticks broke into the military’s headquarters in the city of Rawalpindi, just outside the capital, chanting in support of the former leader.  Protesters also blocked one of the main thoroughfares into Islamabad, throwing stones and pulling down street signs. A police vehicle was set ablaze, resulting in police retaliating with tear gas.  Meanwhile, in the southwestern city of Quetta, a Khan supporter was shot and killed by police at a protest, according to a CNN journalist at the scene.  Authorities blocked mobile internet services shortly after in a bid to quell the chaos, disrupting access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube in the nation of 270 million. Private schools across the country were ordered shut on Wednesday, according to the Private Schools Association.  At least 43 protesters were arrested in Islamabad Tuesday, the city’s police said on Twitter.  Khan, 72, was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote last year and has since led a popular campaign against the current government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accusing it of colluding with the military to remove him from office.  The former star cricketer turned populist politician denies the charges leveled against him, instead accusing Sharif and the military of playing a political game. The military and Sharif – who is in the United Kingdom after attending the coronation of the British monarch – deny Khan’s accusations.  The tensions have brought Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country that has for decades grappled with political instability, into unknown territory and have often boiled over into violence.  Last November, Khan survived a shooting at a political rally, in what his party called an assassination attempt.  And in March, chaos erupted outside Khan’s Lahore home after hundreds of his supporters challenged police and paramilitary troops who had arrived to escort him away. Officers were forced to suspend the operation after protests turned violent – one of multiple unsuccessful attempts by police to arrest Khan.  Khan’s claims have struck a chord with a young population in a country where anti-establishment feelings are common, and are being fueled by a rising cost of living crisis as soaring inflation makes ordinary goods increasingly unaffordable.  Amid the crisis, the government has so far failed to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to restart a $6.5 billion loan program that has stalled since November, in an effort to keep the economy afloat.  The political upheaval appears to have bolstered Khan’s popularity. Last year, his PTI party won local elections in the country’s most populous Punjab province, seen as a litmus test for national elections.",

			"content": "The US economy is going from broken to bizarre.  Covid crashed the American economy three years ago with no playbook for the wild recovery that would follow. Shutdowns and disease outbreaks disrupted global supply chains, leading to the highest inflation in 40 years and (eventually) to aggressive rate hikes from global central banks. Economists have forecast for months that a recession is just around the corner.  And yet, the US economy today is growing, the job market is strong, and the consumer is still spending.  The headlines blare layoffs — from Walmart, Disney, Amazon, 3M, General Motors and Meta — but, overall, hiring picked up speed in April. The economy has added an astonishing 1.2 million jobs this year and the jobless rate matches the lowest since 1969. Despite Silicon Valley pink slips, there is still plenty of hiring happening in technology, especially in computer systems design and services. And construction sites are hopping. The government reported a record 7.9 million people employed in construction jobs in April.  After decades of weak wage growth, workers have enjoyed the best pay gains in a generation, especially workers at the lower end of the pay ladder. Now that inflation appears to be going from a boil to a simmer, it means less of that pay bump is going to cover higher inflation. (Key readings on consumer and producer prices come Wednesday and Thursday.) Those higher wages may complicate the Federal Reserve’s inflation fight, but they may also be underpinning consumer spending, helping the economy avoid a recession.  The narrative seems to shift by the week, in what has been the longest recession watch in memory. Stock markets had a banner winter on hopes the economy was on its way to a possible “soft landing.” Economic growth and inflation have cooled, without a corresponding spike in joblessness. Meantime, the Fed appears to be near the end of its rate-hike cycle. Goldman Sachs pegs recession odds at 35% and Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week said the economy could still skirt a recession.  “Avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than having a recession,” Powell said. “But I don’t rule that out either. It’s possible that we have a mild recession,” he told reporters at a news conference following the central bank’s latest rate decision.  Two dark horses have emerged to challenge the “soft landing” narrative: a regional banking crisis set off by little-known Silicon Valley Bank and a manufactured debt ceiling crisis due to political wrangling. The regional bank strain appears to have stabilized (for now) but the partisan drama over paying the country’s bills holds huge risks.  The US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit before then, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday.  Yet markets have barely flinched. The S&P 500 is up almost 8% this year and the Nasdaq is up 17%.  “I think it’s going to be a difficult couple of weeks,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Global Investors. “As long as the equity market is coming across pretty firm, there’s very little pressure on Congress to come to some agreement. So you do need almost panic stations to arise in order to push them over that line, which is what happened in 2011 and 2013.”  In 2011, Congress reached a deal to raise the debt ceiling two days before the date Treasury estimated money would run out. It triggered the worst week for financial markets since the 2008 financial crisis and earned the United States its first and only credit downgrade. The debate over raising the debt limit in 2013 forced a government shutdown.  This time around, “the financial markets have not shown much anxiety,” said Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist for AGF Investments. “Maybe the T bill market yields have moved higher, but I think for the stock market in general there’s a feeling that, you know, (it’s the) little boy who cried wolf [because] this will get solved at the last minute, which we’ve seen in the past. But this is different. I think the militants in the House are a new factor here and for the markets to be this sanguine to me is not warranted.”  Essentially, many on Wall Street don’t expect lawmakers to understand the urgency of raising the debt ceiling until their constituents’ retirement accounts get hammered first.",

			"content": "Airbnb on Tuesday reported strong revenue growth and a new record for bookings during the first three months of the year, in a sign that demand for travel remains strong despite lingering recession fears.  The company reported revenue for the quarter grew 20% to $1.8 billion, just beating Wall Street’s estimates. The company said nights and experiences booked on the platform hit a record high of over 120 million last quarter.  “More guests are traveling on Airbnb than ever before,” CEO Brian Chesky said on a call with analysts Tuesday. “We’ve seen our highest number of active bookers ever, despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties.”  “During the quarter, we also saw guests booking trips further in advance, supporting a strong backlog for q2,” he added. “We were especially encouraged by the continued recovery of Asia Pacific as nights booked in q1 increased more than 40% year over year.”  Airbnb also reported net income of some $117 million, compared to a net loss in the same period last year.  “We are now twice the size as we were before the pandemic on both a GBV [gross booking value] and revenue basis,” the company said in its letter to shareholders Tuesday.  Despite the rosy earnings report, shares for Airbnb slid as much as 10% in after-hours trading Tuesday after the company reported a weaker outlook for the current quarter than some analysts had expected.  In its letter to shareholders, Airbnb also said it has pulled forward the timing of its marketing spend to the first half of the year to help support the peak summer travel season. The company is also increasing its brand marketing investment in more countries around the world.",
